# Dēmos: Classical Athenian Democracy

A public repository for *Dēmos: Classical Athenian Democracy*. C. Blackwell, editor. This project was created under the editorship of Ross Scaife.

Its original publication on [stoa.org](http://www.stoa.org) has languished. This repository is the site for ongoing development, toward a more stable and flexible resource in the future.
