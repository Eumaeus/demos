<p >(<name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, <title >Against <name  type='person'>Leptines</name></title>; see also <name  n='oratory' type='ancientGenre'>Oratory</name>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> delivered this speech in <date  when='-0355'>355 BCE</date>, and it is the first speech he made on a public matter (Source for date: <bibl >J.H. Vince, <title >Demosthenes I</title> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 487</bibl>). The speech was delivered as part of a <quote >prosecution for illegal legislation</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign>). The case was this: the Athenian democracy relied on its wealthy citizens to pay for certain public works; these were called <soCalled ><term  sortKey='Liturgies'>liturgies</term></soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>λειτουγίαι</foreign>) (see the article, <term  sortKey='Liturgies'>Liturgies</term>). Occasionally, too, the democracy would honor one of its citizens by granting him immunity from <term  sortKey='Liturgies'>liturgies</term>—he and his descendants would no longer be called upon to pay for a service. In <date  when='-0357'>357 BCE</date>, a man named <name  type='person'>Leptines</name> had proposed a law that would end all such exceptions from <term  sortKey='Liturgies'>liturgies</term>, thus providing <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> with additional sources of funds. The law was approved by the <term  sortKey='Nomothetae'>Nomothetae</term> (see also <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>; at <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg020:144' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 20.144</bibl>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> says that more than a year had elapsed between the passage of the law and the trial). Two other Athenians had brought a charge of illegal legislation against <name  type='person'>Leptines</name>, but let the case drop (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg020:145' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 20.145</bibl>). A second charge was brought against the law, and <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> gave this speech making the case against it. <name  type='person'>Leptines</name> himself spoke in the law’s defense (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg020:146' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 20.146</bibl>). </p>
