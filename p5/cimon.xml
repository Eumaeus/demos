     <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName> became increasingly more democratic as the older

    <p><name type="person">Cimon</name> came to public prominence for the first time, it seems, in
      <date when="-0480">480 BCE</date>, when the army from <placeName key="Susa, Persepolis"

     date: <bibl type="secondary">
      <title>OCD</title>

     </bibl>). Faced with an invasion of <placeName key="Attica">Attica</placeName>, the politician
      <name type="person">Themistocles</name> urged the Athenians to abandon the territory of
      <placeName key="Attica">Attica</placeName> to the enemy, take refuge on the island of
      <placeName key="Salamis">Salamis</placeName> and in the <placeName key="Peloponnese"

      >Acropolis</name> and gave his horse’s bridle as a gift to the goddess <name type="god"
      >Athene</name>, thus indicating that he would not need his cavalry equipment, since he would
     trust in the navy. In the ensuing naval battle off the island of <placeName key="Salamis"

      type="cts-urn">Plut. <title>Cim.</title> 5.2-3</bibl>).</p>
    <p>Many ancient writers, often unsympathetic or actively hostile toward the idea of democracy,
     describe the history of <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName> in the <date from="-0499"
      to="-0400">5th</date> and <date from="-0399" to="-0300">4th centuries</date> as an ongoing

     the first of these battles was in the north, in <placeName key="Thrace">Thrace</placeName>,

    <p><placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName> was still the leading city of the defensive

     allowed them to pay money instead of contributing ships, money that the Athenians used to

     army, the people in <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName>, under the leadership of <name

   </div>
   <div n="Reforms Behind Hi Back" type="Section" xml:id="ReformsBehindBack">
    <head>Democratic Reforms Behind Cimon’s Back</head>
    <p>First there is the question of why the Spartans, after summoning the Athenians to help,
     suddenly changed their minds and dismissed them. <name type="ancientAuthor">Plutarch</name>
     says that the Spartans saw the Athenians as <quote>revolutionaries</quote> (<foreign
      xml:lang="grc">νεωτεριστάς</foreign>) (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg035:17.2"
      type="cts-urn">Plut. <title>Cim.</title> 17.2</bibl>). <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Thucydides</name> expands on this, saying that the Spartans, <quote>apprehensive of the
      enterprising and revolutionary character of the Athenians, and further looking upon them as
      foreigners, began to fear that if they remained, they might be tempted by the besieged in
       <placeName key="Ithome">Ithome</placeName> to attempt some political changes. They
      accordingly dismissed them alone of the allies, without declaring their suspicions, but merely
      saying that they had now no need of them</quote> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δείσαντες τῶν
      Ἀθηναίων τὸ τολμηρὸν καὶ τὴν νεωτεροποιίαν, καὶ ἀλλοφύλους ἅμα ἡγησάμενοι, μή τι, ἢν
      παραμείνωσιν, ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν Ἰθώμῃ πεισθέντες νεωτερίσωσι, μόνους τῶν ξυμμάχων ἀπέπεμψαν, τὴν μὲν
      ὑποψίαν οὐ δηλοῦντες, εἰπόντες δὲ ὅτι οὐδὲν προσδέονται αὐτῶν ἔτι</foreign>) (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001:1.102" type="cts-urn">Thuc. 1.102</bibl>).</p>
    <p>Second, there are several passages from ancient authors that say that democratic reforms were
     passed in <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName> while <name type="person">Cimon</name> was
     away. <name type="ancientAuthor">Plutarch</name> suggests this, in very general terms, in his
     biography of <name type="person">Pericles</name>. Once <name type="person">Aristides</name> was
     dead, <name type="ancientAuthor">Plutarch</name> says, and <name type="person"
      >Themistocles</name> was banished and <name type="person">Cimon</name> was generally absent on
     campaigns, <quote><name type="person">Pericles</name> decided to devote himself to the people,
      espousing the cause of the poor and the many instead of the few and the rich, contrary to his
      own nature, which was anything but popular</quote> (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg012:7.2" type="cts-urn">Plut. <title>Per.</title> 7.2</bibl>).
     In his biography of <name type="person">Cimon</name> he is more specific, saying that after
      <name type="person">Cimon</name>’s trial and acquittal, he opposed any democratic reforms,
      <quote>but when he sailed away again on military service, the <term sortKey="People"
       >People</term> got completely beyond control. They confounded the established political order
      of things and the ancestral practices which they had formerly observed, and under the lead of
       <name type="person">Ephialtes</name> they robbed the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the
       Areopagus</term> of all but a few of the cases in its jurisdiction</quote> (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg035:15.1" type="cts-urn">Plut. <title>Cim.</title>
     15.1</bibl>).</p>
    <p>Third, there is evidence to suggest that democratic reforms, and particularly a reform of the
      <term sortKey="Areopagus">Court of the Areopagus</term>, were enacted specifically by the
      <term sortKey="People">People</term> generally, the dēmos (<foreign xml:lang="grc"
      >δῆμος</foreign>), in the absence of <name type="person">Cimon</name> and the wealthier
     Athenians. <name type="ancientAuthor">Diodorus</name> says that it was the <term
      sortKey="Assembly">Assembly</term> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</foreign>), the most
     democratic institution in <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName>, that reformed the <term
      sortKey="Areopagus">Court of the Areopagus</term> (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001:11.77.6" type="cts-urn">Diod. 11.77.6</bibl>). More
     interesting still, <name type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name> attributes the democratic
     reforms after the <term sortKey="Persian_Wars">Persian Wars</term>, and particularly the
     changes to the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Court of the Areopagus</term>, to the <quote>naval
      multitude</quote> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ ναυτικὸς ὄχλος</foreign>) (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1304a" type="cts-urn">Aristot. <title>Pol.</title>
      1304a</bibl>). This <quote>naval multitude</quote> refers to the citizens who were not wealthy
     enough to provide themselves with bronze armor, but could nevertheless serve as rowers on
     warships.</p>
    <p>Fourth, and finally,<name type="ancientAuthor"> Plutarch</name>’s biography of <name
      type="person">Pericles</name>, unlike his biography of <name type="person">Cimon</name>,
     explicitly connects <name type="person">Cimon</name>’s ostracism with <name type="person"
      >Ephialtes</name>’ reform of the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Court of the Areopagus</term>,
     which he calls here the <soCalled>
      <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the Areopagus</term>
     </soCalled>: <quote> Not only was the Council robbed of most of its jurisdiction by <name
       type="person">Ephialtes</name>, but <name type="person">Cimon</name> also, on the charge of
      being a lover of <placeName key="Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and a hater of the <term
       sortKey="People">people</term>, was <term sortKey="Ostracism">ostracized</term></quote>
      (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg012:9.4" type="cts-urn">Plut. <title>Per.</title>
      9.4</bibl>).</p>
    <p>If we put these four categories of evidence together, we might (tentatively) reconstruct
     events as follows: In <date when="-0462">462 BCE</date> the Spartans sent for Athenian help
     during the siege of <placeName key="Ithome">Ithome</placeName> in <placeName key="Messenia"
      >Messenia</placeName>. <name type="person">Cimon</name> marched south with an army that
     consisted of those Athenians wealthy enough to afford the bronze armor necessary for fighting
     on land. While this army was gone, the <term sortKey="Assembly">Assembly</term> at <placeName
      key="Athens">Athens</placeName>, with a smaller-than-usual number of wealthy citizens
     participating, passed democratic reforms, including a reform of the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
      >Court of the Areopagus</term>. Word of this reached <placeName key="Sparta"
      >Sparta</placeName>, and the Spartans (who did not look kindly on reform, certainly not
     democratic reform) decided that the Athenians were dangerous to have around and so dismissed
     them. Upon returning to <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName>, <name type="person"
      >Cimon</name>, who was known for his good relationship with <placeName key="Sparta"
      >Sparta</placeName> and for opposing reforms such as had just been passed, was <term
      sortKey="Ostracism">ostracized</term>.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that the preceding paragraph is one possible interpretation of a few
     pieces of evidence. The evidence, by itself, does not give a full, or consistent, picture of
     events.</p>

    <p>In the earliest stages of the Athenian government that our sources describe, the <term

       >Council of the Areopagus</term> had the official function of guarding the laws, but actually

      3.6</bibl>). In the time of <name type="person">Draco</name>, who (according to legend) first
     gave <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName> a code of laws, <quote>The <term

    <p>As <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName> became gradually more democratic, in the years
     leading up to the <term sortKey="Persian_Wars">Persian Wars</term> (c. <date from="-0481"

      >elected offices</term>) and oligarchic elements (the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the

       <title>Pol.</title> 1273b</bibl>). However, during the chaos of the Persian invasion in <date
      when="-0480">480 BCE</date>, the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the Areopagus</term>
     took a leading role in organizing, and financing, the evacuation of all Athenians to <placeName

     >Peloponnese</placeName>, which raised the body’s status considerably (<bibl

      23.1</bibl>).</p>
    <p>While the evacuation of <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName> raised the prestige of the
      <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>, the ensuing battle in the sea by <placeName
      key="Salamis">Salamis</placeName> may have helped bring about its later fall from power. The
     victory at <placeName key="Salamis">Salamis</placeName> was won by Athens’ fleet, which was
     manned by the general population who may have assumed that their role in the defense of
      <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName> entitled them to a greater role in the city’s
     governance. <name type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name> explicitly contrasts this
      <soCalled>naval crowd</soCalled> with the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the

    <p>In the years following the <term sortKey="Persian_Wars">Persian Wars</term>, we know of two
     events, particularly, that may have motivated the advocates of democracy to try to limit the
     authority of the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the Areopagus</term>. First, <name
      type="person">Themistocles</name>, who was a leader of those who favored democracy (<bibl

      type="cts-urn">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 25.3</bibl>). Second, <name type="person"
      >Cimon</name>, who as we have seen was an opponent of democratic reforms (<bibl

      >Macedonia</placeName> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg035:15.1" type="cts-urn">Plut.

    <p>The ancient sources are in agreement that in <date when="-0462">462 BCE</date>
     <name type="person">Cimon</name> was the principle opponent of reform to the powers of the
      <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the Areopagus</term> (see, for example <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:26.1" type="cts-urn">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title>
      26.1</bibl>; <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg012:9.4" type="cts-urn">Plut.

      <title>OCD</title>
      <edition>3</edition>
     </bibl>). The sources do not agree, however, as to who initiated that reform. <name
      type="ancientAuthor">Plutarch</name> says that it was <name type="person">Ephialtes</name>
     who, <quote>broke down the power of the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the
       Areopagus</term></quote> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg012:7.6" type="cts-urn">Plut.

      Athenians</title>
     <name type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name> says <quote>But as the population increased, <name
       type="person">Ephialtes</name> son of <name type="person">Sophonides</name>, having become
      head of the <term sortKey="People">People</term> and having the reputation of being
      incorruptible and just in regard to the constitution, attacked the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
       >Council of the Areopagus</term></quote> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:25.1"
      type="cts-urn">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 25.1</bibl>). But elsewhere in the same work
     he says that the reform was organized by <name type="person">Ephialtes</name> and <name
      type="person">Themistocles</name> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:25.3"
      type="cts-urn">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 25.3</bibl>), and elsewhere still, he
     mentions <name type="person">Pericles</name> attacking the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of
      the Areopagus</term> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:27.1" type="cts-urn">Aristot.
       <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 27.1</bibl>). <name type="ancientAuthor">Plutarch</name> also
     mentions <name type="person">Pericles</name> at <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg012:9.3"
      type="cts-urn">Plut. <title>Per.</title> 9.3</bibl>. We should probably conclude, although
     cautiously, that <name type="person">Ephialtes</name> was the principle reformer, but that he
     acted with the advice and support of <name type="person">Pericles</name>. <name type="person"
      >Ephialtes</name> is the name most often associated with the reforms, and the following
     passage from <name type="ancientAuthor">Plutarch</name> suggests that, while <name
      type="person">Pericles</name> was a leader of the democratic movement, it was <name
      type="person">Ephialtes</name> who enacted this particular reform: <quote>For this reason all
      the more did <name type="person">Pericles</name>, strong in the affections of the <term
       sortKey="People">people</term>, lead a successful party against the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
       >Council of the Areopagus</term>. Not only was the Council robbed of most of its jurisdiction
      by <name type="person">Ephialtes</name>, but <name type="person">Cimon</name> also, on the
      charge of being a lover of <placeName key="Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and a hater of the <term
       sortKey="People">people</term>, was <term sortKey="Ostracism">ostracized</term>.</quote>
      (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg012:9.4" type="cts-urn">Plut. <title>Per.</title>
      9.4</bibl>).</p>
    <p>What were the reforms? They are discussed at length in the articles on <name type="person"
      >Ephialtes</name> and on the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Court of the Areopagus</term>, but they
     can be summarized briefly here. <name type="ancientAuthor">Plutarch</name> says that the <term
      sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the Areopagus</term> lost jurisdiction over almost all
      <emph>kriseis</emph>, <quote>judgements</quote> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κρίσεις</foreign>)
      (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg035:15.2" type="cts-urn">Plut. <title>Cim.</title>

       <title>Per.</title> 9.5</bibl>). <name type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name> is vague, saying
     that the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the Areopagus</term> was <quote>deprived of
      superintendence of affairs</quote> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπεστερήθη τῆς

       <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 26.1</bibl>). Our best evidence for what authority remained in the
     hands of the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Council of the Areopagus</term> comes from subsequent
     trials that appeared before it. These include trials for homicide, assault and battery, certain
     religious offenses, and arson (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg007:22" type="cts-urn">Lys.
      7.22</bibl>; <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg023:22" type="cts-urn">Dem. 23.22</bibl>;

       <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 60.2</bibl>).</p>
    <p>Immediately after describing the reform of the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Court of the
      Areopagus</term>, <name type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name> mentions that <name
      type="person">Pericles</name> first introduced pay for citizens who served on juries in the
     court of the <term sortKey="lawcourt">Heliaia</term> (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:27.2" type="cts-urn">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title>
      27.2</bibl>). This might indicate that, with many kinds of court cases no longer appearing
     before the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>, there was greater need for citizen
     jurors.</p>
