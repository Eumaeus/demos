<head >Summary</head>
<p >The Council of 500 (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἡ βουλὴ οἱ πεντακόσιοι</foreign>) represented the full-time government of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>. It consisted of 500 citizens, 50 from each of the ten tribes, who served for one year. The Council could issue decrees on its own regarding certain matters, but its main function was to prepare the agenda for meetings of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. The Council would meet to discuss and vote on <soCalled >Preliminary decrees</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>προβουλεύματα</foreign>), and any of these that passed the Council’s vote went on for discussion and voting in the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>.
</p>
</div>

<div  n='General' type='Section' xml:id='General'>
<head >General Principles</head>

<p >The Athenian democracy rested on three institutions: the courts (the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>People’s Court</term> and the <term  sortKey='Areopagus'>Council of the Areopagus</term>), the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, and the Council (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλή</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg020:100' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 20.100</bibl>). At <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>, the Council was formally called the Council of the 500 (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἡ βουλή οἱ πεντακόσιοι</foreign>), to distinguish it from the <term  sortKey='Areopagus'>Council of the Areopagus</term> (see, for example, <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg019:179' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 19.179</bibl>; <bibl  n='SEG 19 133'><title >SEG</title> 19 133</bibl>).</p>

<p >Each member of the Council (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλή</foreign>) was a Councilor (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλεύτης</foreign>, in the plural, <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλεῦται</foreign>) (see for example <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:104' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.104</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg002:14' type='cts-urn'>Andocides 2.14</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> lists service the council among those offices chosen by lot (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>αἱ κληρωταὶ ἀρχαί</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:62.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 62.1</bibl>). He elsewhere says that in a democratic <term >polis</term> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πόλις</foreign>), the Council was the most important board of magistrates (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1322b' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Pol.</title> 1322b</bibl>).</p>

<p >Through most of the <date  from='-0499' to='0300'>5th and 4th centures BCE</date>, citizens were paid for their participation in the Council (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:62.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 62.2</bibl>), and each citizen could serve on the Council twice in his lifetime (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:62.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 62.3</bibl>).</p>

<p >Although participation in the Council was paid, and considered an <soCalled >office</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἀρχή</foreign>), it also seems to have been considered an unexceptional part of a citizen’s life, rather than a part of a political career. In <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plato</name>’s <title >Apology of Socrates</title> (an account, perhaps largely fictional, of the speech <name  type='person'>Socrates</name> gave when on trial for impiety), <name  type='person'>Socrates</name> says that he served on the council (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg002:32a' type='cts-urn'>Plat. <title >Apol.</title> 32a-b</bibl>), but also says that he never participated in politics (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg002:31c' type='cts-urn'>Plat. <title >Apol.</title> 31c-d</bibl>). So, in <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plato</name>’s account, it seems that service on the Council did not indicate political ambition, or even any special interest in politics.</p>
</div>

<div  n='Selection' type='Section' xml:id='Selection'>
<head >Eligibility and Selection</head>

<p >The 500 members of the Council, each one called a <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλευτής</foreign>, or <soCalled >Councilor,</soCalled> were chosen by lot; each of the ten tribes (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>φυλαί</foreign>) of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> contributed 50 Councilors (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.2</bibl>).</p>

<p >A citizen had to be 30 years old to serve on the Council (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg002:1.2.35' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Mem.</title> 1.2.35</bibl>), an age-limit that may have dated back to the time of <name  type='person'>Draco</name> (the semi-mythological first lawgiver of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:4.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 4.3</bibl>). Some Athenians certainly seem to have thought that this age was the traditional limit for service as a Councilor—or thought that making such a claim would sound reasonable—since during the oligarchic coup of <date  when='-0462'>411 BCE</date>, when the democracy was temporarily overthrown, the first act of the oligarchic revolutionaries was to <quote >set up a Council of 400, according to the ways of the ancestors</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλεύειν μὲν τετρακοσίους κατὰ τὰ πάτρια</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:31.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 31.1</bibl>; source for date: <bibl  n='OCD3' type='secondary'><title >OCD</title><edition >3</edition></bibl>), the oligarchic Council was limited to men over thirty years old (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:30.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 30.2</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:31.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 31.1</bibl>).</p>

<p >Citizens probably had to volunteer to serve on the Council, rather than be appointed or drafted into service; in a speech by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name>, the speaker says, <quote >What I say is that only those have the right to sit in Council on our concerns who, besides holding the <term  sortKey='citizenship'>citizenship</term>, have their hearts set upon it</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐγὼ γὰρ οὐκ ἄλλους τινάς φημι δίκαιον εἶναι βουλεύειν περὶ ἡμῶν, ἢ τοὺς πρὸς τῷ εἶναι πολίτας καὶ ἐπιθυμοῦντας τούτου</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg031:5' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 31.5</bibl>; see also<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg031:32' type='cts-urn'> Lys. 31.32-33</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg019:149' type='cts-urn'>Isoc. 15.149</bibl>).</p>

<p >Selection by lot (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κλήρωσις</foreign>) involved bronze tablets (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>χαλκοῦς</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg039:10' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 39.10</bibl>). It is not clear whether all 500 Councilors were chosen at once, in a central location, or whether they were chosen in the various demes. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> refers to <quote >the city selecting <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>Councilors</note> by lot</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἡ πόλις κληροῖ</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg039:10' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 39.10</bibl>), which would suggest a centrally managed process. But <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> says this:</p>

<p ><quote >The officials elected by lot were formerly those elected from the whole tribe together with the <term  sortKey='Archons'>Nine Archons</term> and those now elected in the <name  n='Theseum, Athens' type='site'>Temple of <name  type='person'>Theseus</name></name> who used to be divided among the demes; but since the demes began to sell their offices, the latter also are elected by lot from the whole tribe, excepting members of the Council and Guards; these they entrust to the demes</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:62.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 62.1</bibl>).</p>

<p >This might mean that selection for the Council took place in the individual demes. It is more likely to mean that selection took place centrally, in the <name  n='Theseum, Athens' type='site'>Theseum</name>, the <name  n='Theseum, Athens' type='site'>Temple of <name  type='person'>Theseus</name></name>, and that the 500 places on the Council were divided up not only into 50 for each of the ten tribes, but further within each tribe, so that each deme had a certain number of Councilors on the Council.</p>

<p >The <soCalled >Thesmothetae</soCalled> conducted the selection in the <name  n='Theseum' type='site'>Theseum</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003:13' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 3.13</bibl>); <soCalled >thesmothete</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>θεσμοθέτης</foreign>) was the name given to six of the <term  sortKey='Archons'>Nine Archons</term>, with the other three being the <soCalled ><term  sortKey='Archons'>Archon</term></soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἄρχων</foreign>), the <soCalled ><term  sortKey='Archons'>King Archon</term></soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βασιλεύς</foreign>), and the <soCalled ><term  sortKey='Archons'>Warlord</term></soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πολέμαρχος</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:55.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 55.1</bibl>).</p>

<p >Unlike other political offices in the Athenian democracy, a citizen was not limited to one term of service on the Council, but could serve twice (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:62.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 62.3</bibl>).</p>

<p >We also hear of substitute Councilors, chosen in addition to the 500 Councilors. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> says, speaking against <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>: <quote >Now <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> came in as Councilor, not drawn by the lot either as a member of the senate or as a substitute, but through intrigue and bribery</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐνταῦθ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??εἰσέρχεται βουλευτὴς Δημοσθένης, οὔτε λαχὼν οὔτ᾽ ἐπιλαχών, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκ παρασκευῆς πριάμενος</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003:62' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 3.62</bibl>). A fragment from a comic play by the comic poet <name  type='person'>Plato</name> (not <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plato</name> the philosopher), suggests that each Councilor chosen by lot (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>λαχών</foreign>) had a corresponding substitute (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐπιλαχών</foreign>) assigned to replace him if he proved ineligable for the office:</p>

<p >
<lb />Speaker A: <quote >…you are lucky, Master.</quote>
<lb />Speaker B: <quote >How?</quote>
<lb />Speaker A: <quote >You were almost chosen to be a Councilor, but although you were not chosen, nevertheless you were chosen, if you get my meaning.</quote>
<lb />Speaker B: <quote >How can I get your meaning?</quote>
<lb />Speaker A: <quote >I mean that you were chosen as a substitute for an evil man, a foreigner, who is not even yet a free man.</quote>
<lb />Speaker B: <quote >Get out of here! Indeed, I will explain it to you, the audience: I was chosen as a substitute Councilor for Hyperbolus.</quote>
</p>

<p >(<bibl  n='Plato Comicus, Hyperbolos, fragments 166-167'><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plato Comicus</name>, <title ><name  type='person'>Hyperbolos</name>,</title> fragments 166-167</bibl>)</p>


<p >In this fragmentary excerpt from a comic play, an Athenian citizen seems to be having a conversation with his slave (who calls him <quote >master</quote>). According to the slave, the citizen has not been chosen by lot to serve on the Council, but will nevertheless get to serve. The citizen is slow to catch on, but eventually realizes the slave’s meaning: because the citizens has been <quote >chosen as a substitute Councilor</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλῆς ἐπέλαχον</foreign>) for <name  type='person'>Hyperbolus</name>, he will almost certainly get to serve on the Council after all, because <name  type='person'>Hyperbolus</name> is such an evil man that he will inevitably get expelled. This passage is obviously a joke at the expense of <name  type='person'>Hyperbolus</name>, but it probably reflects a reality of the Council: not only were substitute Councilors (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐπιλαχόντες</foreign>) chosen, but each one was chosen as a substitute for a specific Councilor. If a Councilor chosen by lot should be expelled from the body, then the <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐπιλαχών</foreign> chosen for him would take his seat.</p>
</div>

<div  n='Scrutiny' type='Section' xml:id='Scrutiny'>
<head >Scrutiny of Councilors</head>

<p >Before taking their seats on the Council, newly selected Councilors had to undergo <soCalled >scrutiny</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δοκιμασία</foreign>), an audit of their fitness to serve (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:45.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 45.3</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> makes the claim that the <soCalled >law of scrutiny</soCalled> was primarily intended to deny political office to men who had participated in one of the short-lived oligarchic coups of the <date  from='0499' to='0400'>5th century BCE</date>, or the Tyranny of the Thirty (these events are discussed below) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg026:9-10' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 26.9-10</bibl>). But scrutiny was a broadly important institution in the Athenian democracy, and <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name>’ statement is probably too narrow to reflect strictly historical reality.</p>

<p >The <term  sortKey='Archons'>Nine Archons</term> underwent scrutiny before taking office (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:55.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 55.2</bibl>), as did the ten <term  sortKey='generals'>generals</term> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg015:1-2' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 15.1-2</bibl>), and priests, advocates, heralds, and ambassadors (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:19-20' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.19-20</bibl>). In fact, according to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>, any citizen could call upon any other citizen to undergo scrutiny at any time, to determine whether he deserved the privilege of speaking before the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:32' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.32</bibl>). Furthermore, every young Athenian man underwent a scrutiny before the members of his deme before he was enrolled in the list of citizens (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg044:41' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 44.41</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg026:21' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 26.21</bibl>).</p>

<p >The scrutiny of newly selected Councilors was managed by the Thesmothetae, the lower six of the nine <term  sortKey='Archons'>archons</term> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:59.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 59.4</bibl>), but it was the outgoing Council that decided whether each of the 500 new Councilors was eligible to take office (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:45.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 45.3</bibl>). During this process, other citizens were invited to give testimony, under oath, before the Council (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg031:1' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 31.1-2</bibl>). Given the large number of Councilors who had to be scrutinized each year, it would be surprising if each candidate were given lengthy consideration, and in fact, a passage from <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> admits that the scrutiny of a potential Councilor—who was one of 500 men serving for only one year—was ususally less strict than scrutiny of a candidate for the <term  sortKey='Areopagus'>Areopagus</term>, who would hold that office for life (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg026:11' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 26.11-12</bibl>).</p>

<p >This scrutiny took into account almost every aspect of a citizen’s life, public and private, and we can learn much about the values of the Athenian democracy from the questions asked during a scrutiny, and grounds for which a candidate could fail his scrutiny.</p>

<p >According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name>, a candidate for the Council was asked, <quote >Who is your father and to what deme does he belong, and who is your father’s father, and who is your mother, and who is her father and what is his deme? Then whether he has a Family Apollo and Homestead Zeus, and where these shrines are; then whether he has family tombs and where they are; then whether he treats his parents well, and whether he pays his taxes, and whether he has done his military service</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:55.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 55.3-4</bibl>). According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name>, they were also asked if they honored their family graves (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg002:2.2.13' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Mem.</title> 2.2.13</bibl>).</p>

<p >After the candidate was asked the standard questions, the floor was open for any interested citizen to bring accusations against the candidate, and if anyone did so, the candidate could speak in his own defense (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:55.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 55.4</bibl>).</p>

<p >In <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>’ speech against <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name>, in which the orator accuses <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name> of having been a prostitute, he gives a long list of crimes and misdeeds that, according to the Law of Scrutiny of Public Speakers (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δοκιμασία ῥητόρων</foreign>), would make a man ineligible to address the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>; we can probably assume that the same offenses that would cause a citizen to lose that right would also cause him to lose the right to serve on the Council. Those ineligable to address the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> include, according to the orator, anyone <quote >living a shameful life</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>αἰσχρῶς βεβιωκότας</foreign>), anyone who beats his father or mother or who has failed to support and provide a home for them, anyone failing to perform military service or who has thrown away his shield in battle, anyone who has prostituted himself, and anyone who has squandered his inheritance (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:28' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.28-30</bibl>).</p>

<p >By the <date  from='-0399' to='-0375'>early 4th century</date>, the Athenian democracy, barely one hundred years old, had experienced a period in which an oligarchy had taken power away from the People, and another period under the tyranny of the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty Tyrants</term> (these events are discussed in the <term  sortKey='council_history'>article on the history of the Council</term>). It is not surprising, then, that in the time of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name>—who lived from around <date  from='-0445' to='-0380'>445 BCE until around 380 BCE</date>—candidates for the Council were scrutinized for any sign that they had supported these anti-democratic governments (source for date: <bibl  type='secondary'>Perseus Encyclopedia, s.v. <soCalled ><name  type='person'>Lysias</name></soCalled></bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> even claims that this was the main purpose of scrutiny: <quote >Reflect also on the fact that the author of the law concerning scrutinies had chiefly in view the magistrates of the oligarchy; for he thought it monstrous that the men responsible for the overthrow of the democracy should regain office under that very constitution, and get control over the laws and over the city of which they had formerly taken charge only to maim her with such shameful and terrible injuries</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg026:9' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 26.9</bibl>). The orator continues to note, specifically, that if candidate were found to have served in the cavalry during the Tyranny of the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty</term>, <quote >you would reject him even without an accuser</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg026:10' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 26.10</bibl>). In a speech that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> wrote against an Athenian named <name  type='person'>Philon</name>, the speaker urges the Council to reject the man, not because he actively supported the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Tyranny</term>, but merely because he failed to oppose it actively (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg031:12' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 31.12-14</bibl>).</p>

<p >Elsewhere in that same speech, we find the assertion that <quote >only those have the right to sit in Council on our concerns who, besides holding the <term  sortKey='citizenship'>citizenship</term>, have their hearts set upon it</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg031:5' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 31.5</bibl>). It is possible that a candidate could fail his scrutiny merely for showing too little enthusiasm for the office, but this passage is probably nothing more than a rhetorical statement intended to show that the speaker holds <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>’ democratic institutions in the highest regard.</p>

<p >After the candidate answered the questions, and any accusers had come forward, the Council voted by show of hands (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐπιχειροτονία</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:55.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 55.4</bibl>). According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name>, originally the vote of the Council was the last word in a scrutiny, but in his time (<date  from='-0375' to='-0325'>the middle of the 4th century BCE</date>) <quote >there is an appeal to the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>Jury-court</term>, and with this rests the final decision as to qualification</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:55.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 55.2</bibl>).</p>

<p >A passage from a speech by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> confirms that a candidate who was rejected by the Council could appeal to a jury, while noting that this appeal could take time, and might result in the year beginning without a full body of magistrates in office (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg026:6' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 26.6</bibl>).</p>

<p >In addition to the evidence suggesting that Councilors would be rejected for various offenses, including having served in the cavalry during the rule of the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty Tyrants</term>, there is evidence that these rules were not hard and fast. In the speech <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> wrote for <name  type='person'>Mantitheus</name>, who was defending himself in a scrutiny, he suggests that the Council, or a jury hearing an appeal, could take into account mitigating circumstances: <quote >Besides, gentlemen if I had served <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>in the cavalry under the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty Tyrants</term></note>, I should not deny it as though I had done something monstrous: I should merely claim, after showing that no citizen had suffered injury by my act, to pass the scrutiny. And I see that you also take this view, and that many of those who served then in the cavalry are on the Council, while many others have been elected generals and brigadiers</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg016:8' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 16.8</bibl>). The speaker is suggesting that men who were technically ineligable for service on the Council could be, and were, approved if they could show that they had not harmed anyone.</p>

<p >In the speech against <name  type='person'>Philon</name>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> suggests that crimes in a candidate’s past could be balanced by subsequent service to the Athenian democracy. Here he asks his audience to reject <name  type='person'>Philon</name>’s candidacy, because of the man’s past crimes, until he has done good deeds sufficient to redeem himself: <quote >What inducement, then, could you have for approving this man? Because he has committed no offence ? But he is guilty of the gravest crimes against his country. Or do you think he will reform? Then, I say, let him reform first in his bearing towards the city, and claim a seat on the Council later, when he has done her a service as signal as the wrong that he did her before</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg031:24' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 31.24</bibl>).</p>

<p > After the scrutiny was completed, those who had passed were ceremonially sworn into service as Councilors for the year: <quote >And when the matter has been checked in this way, they go to the stone on which are the victims cut up for sacrifice (the one on which Arbitrators also take oath before they issue their decisions, and persons summoned as witnesses swear that they have no evidence to give), and mounting on this stone they swear that they will govern justly and according to the laws, and will not take presents on account of their office, and that if they should take anything they will set up a golden statue. After taking oath they go from the stone to the <name  n='Acropolis, Athens' type='site'>Acropolis</name> and take the same oath again there, and after that they enter on their office</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:55.5' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath.

<head >The Bouleutic Oath</head>

<p >Upon passing their scrutiny (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δοκιμασία</foreign>), the new Councilors swore the so-called <soCalled >Bouleutic Oath.</soCalled> According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name>, this practice dated back to the eighth year after <name  type='person'>Cleisthenes</name> established the democracy, or <date  when='-0500'>501/500 BCE</date> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:22.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 22.2</bibl>; source for date, <bibl  type='secondary'>Rhodes, <title >Commentary on the Aristotelian <title >Athenaion Politeia</title></title> [Oxford, 1993] 262</bibl>).</p>

<p >There is no single literary text or inscription that records the oath that the Councilors (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλτεῦται</foreign>) swore, but we can reconstruct it from scattered comments and references in different texts and inscriptions. It is important to remember, however, that these sources are from different dates, some from the <date  from='-0499' to='-0400'>5th century</date> (<name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name>), some from the early <date  from='-0399' to='-0375'>4th century</date> (<name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name>), and some from the later <date  from='-0375' to='-0322'>4th century BCE</date> (<name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>). It is unlikely that the oath remained the same in wording and content over the course of 200 years. Nevertheless, the evidence we have does give us a picture of how the Athenians both empowered, and limited the power of, the Council.</p>

<p >The Councilors swore <quote >to advise according to the laws</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κατὰ τοὺς νόμους βουλεύσειν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg002:1.1.18' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Mem.</title> 1.1.18</bibl>). According to two passages from <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name>, they swore <quote >to advise what was best for the city</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὰ βέλτιστα βουλεύσειν τῇ πόλει</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg031:2' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 31.2</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg030:10' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 30.10</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> mentions Councilors swearing to advise <quote >what was best for the People</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὰ βέλτιστα βουλεύσειν τῷ δήμῳ Ἀθηναίων</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg059:4' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 59.4</bibl>).</p>

<p >According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, the Councilors included this clause in their oath: <quote >Nor will I imprison any Athenian citizen who provides three people to guarantee his debt, guarantors who are in the same tax-bracket, except anyone found guilty of conspiring to betray the city or to subvert the democracy, or anyone who has contracted to collect taxes, or his guarantor, or his collector who is in default</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>οὐδὲ δήσω Ἀθηναίων οὐδένα, ὃς ἂν ἐγγυητὰς τρεῖς καθιστῇ τὸ αὐτὸ τέλος τελοῦντας, πλὴν ἐάν τις ἐπὶ προδοσίᾳ τῆς πόλεως ἢ ἐπὶ καταλύσει τοῦ δήμου συνιὼν ἁλῷ, ἢ τέλος πριάμενος ἢ ἐγγυησάμενος ἢ ἐκλέγων μὴ καταβάλῃ</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:144' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.144</bibl>). This clause would prevent a creditor from having an Athenian citizen arrested for debt, assuming that the citizen could provide three other citizens who would co-sign his debt; the exceptions are traitors, and <soCalled >tax-farmers,</soCalled> that is, men who had paid for the privilege of collecting taxes on behalf of the Athenian government. A few sentences later in the same speech, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> claims that <name  type='person'>Solon</name>, the law-giver of the <date  from='-0599' to='-0500'>6th century BCE</date>, was responsible for this provision (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg022:148' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.148</bibl>).</p>

<p >A passage from a speech attributed to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Andocides</name> claims that the <quote >oath of the People and the Council</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τῷ ὅρκῳ τοῦ δήμου καὶ τῆς βουλῆς</foreign>) included a promise <quote >not to exile, nor imprison, nor execute anyone without a trial</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>μηδένα μήτε ἐξελᾶν μήτε δήσειν μήτε ἀποκτενεῖν ἄκριτον</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg004:3' type='cts-urn'>Andoc. 4.3</bibl>).</p>

<p >According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name>, Councilors swore an oath, <quote >to let it be known if he knows of anyone who has been selected by lot but is not fit to serve on the Council</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἀποφανεῖν εἴ τίς τινα οἶδε τῶν λαχόντων ἀνεπιτήδειον ὄντα βουλεύειν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg031:2' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 31.2</bibl>), and <quote >to crown a man as worthy of public office only after scrutinizing him</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δοκιμάσαντες τὸν ἄξιον τῆς ἀρχῆς στεφανώσειν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg026:8' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 26.8</bibl>).</p>

<p >A fragmentary quotation from the ancient historian <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Philochorus</name> adds to our list of clauses in the Bouleutic Oath: <quote >And the Council at that time began for the first time to sit according to letters; and even now they swear to sit in the letter to which they have been randomly assigned</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>καὶ ἡ βουλὴ κατὰ γράμμα τότε πρῶτον ἐκαθέζετο· καὶ ἔτι νῦν ὀμνῦσιν ἀπ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἐκείνου καθεδεῖσθαι ἐν τῶι γράμματι ὧι ἂν λάχωσιν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='Philoch. 328 F 140'>Philoch. 328 F 140</bibl>; quoted in a scholion, or marginal note, to <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg011:972' type='cts-urn'>Aristoph. <title >Pl.</title> 972</bibl>). This <quote >sitting by letters</quote> seems to mean that Councilors were assigned seats for their meetings, and they swore to sit only in their assigned seats. This might have been intended to prevent factions from forming within the Council, as might happen if all of the Councilors from one deme sat together when the whole body met.</p>

<p >An inscription from <date  when='-0448'>448 BCE</date> records an addition to the Bouleutic Oath. The added clause commits the Council to ensuring that only Athenian money be used in the cities that pay tribute to <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>. The text of the inscription has had to be restored by modern scholars (as with virtually all inscriptions), but it has been reconstructed to read: <quote >And the secretary of the Council is to add a clause to the Oath of the Council, to this effect: Should anyone mint coins of silver in the cities and not use Athenian coins, standard weights, or standard measures, but uses foreign coins, weights, and measures, we will punish him and fine him according to the earlier decree that <name  type='person'>Clearchus</name> sponsored</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>προσγράψαι δὲ πρὸς τὸν ὅρκον τὸν τῆς βολῆς τὸν γραμματέα τὸν τῆς βολῆς ταδί· ἐάν τις κόπτῆι νόμισμα ἀργυρίο ἐν τῆσι πόλεσι καὶ μὴ χρῆται νομίσμασι τοῖς Ἀθηναίων ἢ σταθμοῖς ἢ μέτροις ἀλλὰ ξενικοῖς νομίσμασιν καὶ μέτροις καὶ στάθμοις, τιμωρήσομαι καὶ ζημιώσω κατὰ τὸ πρότερον ψήφισμα ὃ Κλέαρχος εἶπεν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 1.3 1453'><title >IG</title> I<edition >3</edition> 1453</bibl>; source for date: <bibl  type='secondary'>P.J. Rhodes, <title >The Athenian Boule</title> [Oxford, 1972] 194</bibl>).</p>

<p >A speech by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> quotes portions of a different oath, the one sworn by jurors in the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>People’s Court</term>. These jurors swore, among other things, that <quote >I am not less than thirty years old</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>γέγονα οὐκ ἔλαττον ἢ τριάκοντα ἔτη</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:151' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.151</bibl>). Since <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name> tells us that Councilors also had to be at least thirty years old (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg002:1.2.35' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Mem.</title> 1.2.35</bibl>), it is possible that Councilors likewise swore that they met the age requirement. On the other hand, as P.J. Rhodes has pointed out, such an oath might not have been necessary once each candidate for the Council had undergone scrutiny (see <bibl  type='secondary'>P.J. Rhodes, <title >The Athenian Boule</title> [Oxford, 1972] 195</bibl>).</p>

<head ><soCalled >Presidents</soCalled> and <soCalled >Chairman</soCalled></head>

<p >Five hundred Councilors served on the <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλή</foreign> for the year, but practical concerns required that they be divided into smaller groups. Accordingly, the legislative year was divided into ten parts, each called a <soCalled >prytany</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πρυτανεία</foreign>); for each prytany, the fifty Councilors (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλεῦται</foreign>) from one of the ten tribes (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>φυλαί</foreign>) served as <soCalled >presidents,</soCalled> or prytanes (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πρυτάνεις</foreign>, in the singular, <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πρύτανις</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.2-3</bibl>; the inscription <bibl >Agora 15.38</bibl> contains a list of tribes and when they held the prytany). The first four prytanies were 36 days long, the last six were 35 days long, <quote >for the year is divided into lunar months</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.2</bibl>).</p>

<p >The order in which the Councilors from each tribe served as presidents was random, determined by lot (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.2</bibl>). The random determination seems to have taken place at the end of each prytany (rather than all at once at the beginning of the year), so no one could predict which tribe would serve next. An inscription makes reference to <quote >the presidents, whichever ones might hold that position after the tribe of <name  n='Oineis' type='tribe'>Oineis</name></quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τοὺς πρυτάνεις οἳ ἂν τυγχάνωσι πρυτανεύοντες μετὰ τὴν Οἰνηΐδα φυλὴν</foreign>) (<bibl ><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 553.16-17</bibl>). When the decree was written, the Councilors from the tribe of Oineis were serving as prytanes, or presidents; the decree needed to refer to the next group of presidents, but that group was clearly not known. So, we can infer from this that the selection must have happened toward the end of a prytany. Obviously, during the ninth prytany of the year, it would be obvious that whichever tribe had not yet served would hold the presidency for the final prytany.</p>

<p >This elaborate randomization of the presidency was probably intended to limit possibilities for corruption. No one could plan to introduce business to the Council when a particular tribe held the presidency, and no Councilor could know in advance when he would serve as a president.</p>

<p >The presidents ate their meals together in the <name  n='Tholos, Athens' type='site'>Tholos</name>, the <soCalled >Round House.</soCalled> They planned and organized meetings of the Council and posted an agenda for each meeting beforehand (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.3</bibl>; meetings of the Council are discussed below).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> tells us that <quote >There is a chairman of the presidents, one man, chosen by lot; this man chairs for a night and a day—no longer—and cannot become chairman a second time</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἔστι δ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἐπιστάτης τῶν πρυτάνεων εἷς ὁ λαχών. οὗτος δ᾽ ἐπιστατεῖ νύκτα καὶ ἡμέραν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν οὔτε πλείω χρόνον οὔτε δὶς τὸν αὐτὸν γενέσθαι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.1</bibl>). This chairman kept the keys to the treasuries and archives of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>, as well as the state seal (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὴν δημοσίαν σφραγῖδα</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.1</bibl>).</p>

<p >In addition to a daily meeting of all the presidents, the chairman and one third of the presidents were required to be on hand in the <name  n='Tholos, Athens' type='site'>Tholos</name> constantly (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.1</bibl>); presumably only the chairman was on duty for a full 24 hours, and the other presidents could divide the day into 8 hour shifts. These men, on-call in the <name  n='Tholos, Athens' type='site'>Tholos</name>, represented the whole government of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> in a time of crisis, at least until the full Council or <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> could be convened. Heralds and envoys from other states came to the presidents in the <name  n='Tholos, Athens' type='site'>Tholos</name> first, as did messenger bearing official letters (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.6' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.6</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> describes a dramatic scene, that shows clearly the function of the presidents and the chairman. In <date  when='-0339'>339 BCE</date>, <name  type='person'>Philip</name> of <placeName  key='Macedon'>Macedon</placeName> marched his army south and captured the city of <placeName  key='Elatea'>Elatea</placeName>, thus threatening <placeName  key='Thebes'>Thebes</placeName> and the Thebans’ southern neighbor, <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> (source for date: <bibl  type='secondary'>Raphael Sealey, <title >Demosthenes and his Time: a study in defeat</title> [Oxford, 1993] 195</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> describes what happened when news of this threat came to <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>:</p>

<p ><quote >Evening had already fallen when a messenger arrived bringing to the presiding councillors (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πρυτάνεις</foreign>) the news that <placeName  key='Elatea'>Elatea</placeName> had been taken. They were sitting at supper, but they instantly rose from table, cleared the booths in the marketplace of their occupants, and unfolded the hurdles, while others summoned the commanders and ordered the attendance of the trumpeter. The commotion spread through the whole city. At daybreak on the next day the presidents summoned the Council to the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>, and the citizens flocked to the place of <term  sortKey='Assembly'>assembly</term>. Before the Council could introduce the business and prepare the agenda, the whole body of citizens had taken their places on the hill. The Council arrived; the presiding Councilors formally reported the intelligence they had received; and the courier was introduced</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg018:169' type='cts-urn'>Dem.18.169-170</bibl>).</p>

<p >So, in a crisis, the safety of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> lay first in the hands of the presidents and the chairman. It is worth noting that because there were 354 days in the legislative year (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.2</bibl>), more than two thirds of all Councilors would serve as chairman for a night and a day in a given year.</p>

<p >There are further implications, if we accept the estimate of two scholars that in <date  when='-0400'>400 BCE</date> there were approximately 22,000 adult male citizens—it is beyond the scope of this article to give evidence and justification for this, but the arguments are presented in <bibl  type='secondary'>Victor Ehrenberg, <title >The Greek State</title>, 2nd English Edition (Methuen, 1969) 31</bibl>, whose estimate is 20,000-25,000, and in <bibl  type='secondary'>A.W. Gomme, <title >The Population of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> in the Fifth and Fourth Centuries B.C.</title> (Blackwell, 1933) 26</bibl>, whose estimate is 22,000.</p>

<p >A citizen had to be 30 years old to serve as a Councilor (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg002:1.2.35' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Mem.</title> 1.2.35</bibl>). For the sake of argument, we might assume that the average citizen would then have an active political life of 30 years, until he was 60. During that time, there would need to be approximately 10,000 chairmen, each controlling the state seal and the treasuries, and presiding over the presidents of the Council for a day and a night (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.1</bibl>). Since no one could serve as chairman twice (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.1</bibl>), this office would have to go to 10,000 different Athenians. It follows, then, that approximately one half of all Athenian citizens would, at some point during their lives, have the privilege and responsibility of holding this office, arguably the closest equivalent to a Chief Executive in the Athenian democracy.</p>
 </div>

<div  n='Rewards' type='Section' xml:id='Rewards'>
<head >Rewards for Service</head>

<p >Service on the Council was a privilege, but also a responsibility, a responsibility often difficult for an Athenian citizen to fulfill. The territory of <placeName  key='Attica'>Attica</placeName> was large, and any Councilor who lived outside of the city of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> would have faced a long walk before and after every meeting. A passage from <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> confirms what common sense would suggest: that there were always Councilors who were not active participants in the business of the Council, and who did not even attend all of the meetings. In this passage, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> is asking, rhetorically, whether every member of the Council will suffer if the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> fails to award the Councilors a crown in honor of their service. <note  place='inline' resp='CWB' type='reference'>the business of awarding crown to the Council is described below.</note> <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> asks, <quote >If the Council does not receive a crown, does the disgrace fall on the one who is silent, and proposes no decree, and perhaps does not even enter the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name> most of the time? Surely it does not.</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τῷ γάρ ἐστιν ὄνειδος, εἰ σιωπῶντος αὐτοῦ καὶ μηδὲν γράφοντος, ἴσως δ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??οὐδὲ τὰ πόλλ᾽ εἰς τὸ βουλευτήριον εἰσιόντος, μὴ λάβοι ἡ βουλὴ τὸν στέφανον; οὐδενὶ δήπουθεν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg022:36' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 22.36</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’ rhetorical question would not have been particularly meaningful or effective if his audience did not know that at least some Councilors skipped meetings. So what incentives induced Councilors to attend? We have already seen that the Presidents (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πρυτάνεις</foreign>)—who had daily duty during their month of service—had their meals provided in the <name  n='Tholos, Athens' type='site'>Tholos</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.3</bibl>). It would make sense that they simply lived in the city of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> during that month. In <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plato</name>’s philophical dialogue, the <title >Laws</title>, one of the characters is <soCalled >the Athenian</soCalled>, and this character says that in a properly organized state the Councilors in general can live in the countryside during the year, but the Presidents of the Council should remain in <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> while they serve their term (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg034:758b-758d' type='cts-urn'>Plat. <title >Laws</title> 758b-d</bibl>). This work is not <name  n='history' type='ancientGenre'>history</name>, but <name  n='philosophy' type='ancientGenre'>philosophy</name>, and the characters are discussing an ideal state, but it is quite possible that <soCalled >the Athenian</soCalled> here is describing actual practice in <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>.</p>

<p >Councilors were paid to attend meetings of the Council. In the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century BCE</date>, each Councilor received 5 obols at each meeting of the Council (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:62.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 62.2</bibl>), and the Presidents received an extra obol for their meals (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:62.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 62.2</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.3</bibl>; see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001:8.69.4' type='cts-urn'>Thuc. 8.69.4</bibl> for evidence that the Councilors received some pay in the <date  from='-0499' to='-0400'>5th century</date> as well).</p>

<p >Councilors were exempt from military service during their year in office (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0034.tlg001:37' type='cts-urn'>Lyc. 1.37</bibl>). They also got to wear a crown (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>στέφανος</foreign>) to mark their status (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0034.tlg001:122' type='cts-urn'>Lyc. 1.122</bibl>). A certain section of seat in the <name  n='Theater of Dionysus, Athens' type='site'>Theater of <name  type='god'>Dionysus</name></name> was called the Council Section (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλευτικός</foreign>), which suggests that Councilors enjoyed preferred seating (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg006:794' type='cts-urn'>Aristoph. <title >Birds</title> 794</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg9010.tlg001:beta.430' type='cts-urn'>Suda beta,430</bibl>).</p>

<p >At the end of the year, the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> could award the Council an honorary crown (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>στέφανος</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:112' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.112</bibl>); this award is also referred to as an <soCalled >honorarium</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δωρεά</foreign>; see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:46.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 46.1</bibl>).</p> 

<p >It seems that the Council had to request that award, specifically from the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, and put the request on the agenda for a meeting of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, as the end of the year approached. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> tells us that, if the Council had not fulfilled its reponsibilities toward the Athenian navy, it was not eligible to receive its honorarium (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:46.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. Ath. Pol. 46.1</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> also mentions the <quote >the law that specifically denies to the Council the right to request an honorarium if they have not built the warships</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τοῦ νόμου τοῦ διαρρήδην οὐκ ἐῶντος ἐξεῖναι μὴ ποιησαμένῃ τῇ βουλῇ τὰς τριήρεις αἰτῆσαι τὴν δωρειάν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg022:8' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 22.8</bibl>). This passage confirms what <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> says—that the honorarium was not automatic, but depended on the Council’s fulfilling its responsibilities. It also informs us that, even if the Council did fulfill its responsibilties, it did not have the right to an honorium, but the right to request one (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>αἰτῆσαι τὴν δωρειάν</foreign>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> mentions one occasion on which the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> withheld the honorarium from the Council, due to the Council’s failure to punish two men suspected of embezzling funds from the treasury of <name  type='god'>Athene</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:110' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.110-113</bibl>).</p>

<p >Individual Councilors could be honored for exceptional service as well. An inscription from the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century BCE</date> lists the names of Athenians <quote >whom the People judged to have served best as Councilors</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τούσδε ἐστεφάνωσεν ὁ δῆμος κρίνας ἄριστα βεβουλευκέναι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 2797 A'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 2797 A</bibl>).</p>

<p >So, while we have seen evidence that not all Councilors took an active role, or even attended all the meetings, the Athenian democracy paid every Councilor for his daily service, afforded all Councilors certain privileges, could award the Council as a whole for having done good service, and could single out individual citizens whose service was exceptional.</p>

<head >Times and Places of Meetings</head>

<p >The Chairman (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐπιστάτης</foreign>) and one third of the Presidents (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πρυτάνεις</foreign>) of the Council were always on duty (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.1</bibl>). These Presidents convened meetings of the council, <quote >the Council, indeed, meeting every day, unless the day is exempt</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὴν μὲν οὖν βουλὴν ὅσαι ἡμέραι, πλὴν ἐάν τις ἀφέσιμος ᾖ</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath.

<p >We cannot examine all of the evidence regarding the Athenian calendar, to develop a full picture of what days during the year were <soCalled >exempt</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἀφέσιμος</foreign>) from meetings of the Council—Jon D. Mikalson, <title >The Sacred and Civil Calendar of the Athenian Year</title> (Princeton, 1975) is the most complete presentation of that evidence. But we can see a few examples of occasions on which the Council did not meet.</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, for example, accuses a certain <name  type='person'>Timocrates</name> of having taken unjust advantage of an <soCalled >exempt</soCalled> day: <quote >The assembly at which your vote was taken fell on the eleventh of Hecatombaeon, and he introduced his law on the twelfth, the very next day, although it was a feast of <name  type='god'>Cronus</name> and the Council therefore stood adjourned.</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἀλλὰ τῆς ἐκκλησίας, ἐν ᾗ τοὺς νόμους ἐπεχειροτονήσατε, οὔσης ἑνδεκάτῃ τοῦ ἑκατομβαιῶνος μηνός, δωδεκάτῃ τὸν νόμον εἰσήνεγκεν, εὐθὺς τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ, καὶ ταῦτ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ὄντων Κρονίων καὶ διὰ ταῦτ᾽ ἀφειμένης τῆς βουλῆς</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:26' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.26</bibl>).</p>

<p >According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, <name  type='person'>Timocrates</name> conspired with a certain <name  type='person'>Epicrates</name> to have a decree passed in the Council; the text of the decree (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ψήφισμα</foreign>) is reported in <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’ speech as follows:</p>

<p ><quote >During the first presidency, namely, that of the Tribe <name  type='tribe'>Pandionis</name>, and on the eleventh day of that presidency, it was moved by <name  type='person'>Epicrates</name> that, in order that the sacrifices may be offered, that provision may be adequate, and that any lack of funds for the Panathenian Festival may be made good, the Presidents of the Tribe <name  type='tribe'>Pandionis</name> do tomorrow set up a <term  sortKey='Legislation'>Legislative Committee</term>, and that such <term  sortKey='Legislation'>Legislative Committee</term> do consist of one thousand and one citizens who have taken the oath, and that the Council co-operate therewith in legislative business.</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:27' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.27</bibl>).</p>

<p >Since <quote >tomorrow</quote> was the feast of <name  type='god'>Cronus</name>, a day on which the Council did not meet (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:26' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.26</bibl>), this decree created a board of <term  sortKey='Legislation'>Nomothetae</term> without the consent of the full Council (for the <term  sortKey='Legislation'>Nomothetae</term>, see the article on <term  sortKey='Legislation'>Legislation</term>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Athenaeus</name> mentions a decree that gives the Council a holiday for the festival of the Apaturia: <quote >So that the Council might celebrate the Apaturia with the rest of the Athenians, according to the traditional ways, it has been decreed by the Council that the Councilors be dismissed for those days that the other offices have off, that is, five days starting from the day on which the Protenthae celebrate the opening feast of the Apaturia</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ὅπως ἂν ἡ βουλὴ ἄγῃ τὰ Ἀπατούρια μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων Ἀθηναίων κατὰ τὰ πάτρια, ἐψηφίσθαι τῇ βουλῇ ἀφεῖσθαι τοὺς βουλευτὰς τὰς ἡμέρας ἅσπερ καὶ αἱ ἄλλαι ἀρχαὶ αἱ ἀφεταὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς οἱ προτένθαι ἄγουσι πέντε ἡμέρας</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:4.171e' type='cts-urn'>Athen. 4.171e</bibl>).</p>

<p >An exchange between two characters in <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristophanes</name>’ comedy, the <title >Thesmophoriazousae</title>, suggests that the Council did not meet during the Thesmophoria: <quote ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Euripides</name>: This day will decide whether it is all over with <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Euripides</name> or not. <name  type='person'>Mnesilochus</name>: But how? Neither the tribunals nor the Council are sitting, for it is the third day of the Thesmophoria.</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>Εὐριπίδης· τῇδε θἠμέρᾳ κριθήσεται εἴτ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἔστ᾽ ἔτι ζῶν εἴτ᾽ ἀπόλωλ᾽ Εὐριπίδης. Μνησίλοχος· καὶ πῶς; ἐπεὶ νῦν γ᾽ οὔτε τὰ δικαστήρια μέλλει δικάζειν οὔτε βουλῆς ἐσθ᾽ ἕδρα, ἐπεὶ τρίτη ᾽στὶ Θεσμοφορίων ἡ μέση.</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg008:77-81' type='cts-urn'>Aristoph. <title >Thes.</title> 77-81</bibl>).</p>

<p >And <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plutarch</name>’s biography of <name  type='person'>Alcibiades</name> describes the festival of the Plynteria, saying that <quote >the Athenians regard this days as the unluckiest of all days for business of any sort</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ὅθεν ἐν ταῖς μάλιστα τῶν ἀποφράδων τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην ἄπρακτον Ἀθηναῖοι νομίζουσιν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015:34.1' type='cts-urn'>Plut. <title >Alc.</title> 34.1</bibl>).</p>

<p >So, without going into the complexities of the Athenian civic and religious calendar, we can get an idea of the occasions on which the Council would not meet.</p>

<p >In addition to regular meetings of the Council, called by the Presidents every day except for <soCalled >exempt days</soCalled>, the Council seems to have met after each meeting of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. An anecdote from <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> suggests this. At a meeting of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, a man named <name  type='person'>Pamphilus</name>, of the deme Acherdous, accused two men, <name  type='person'>Hegesandrus</name> and <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name>, of embezzling one thousand drachmas from the treasury of <name  type='god'>Athene</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:110' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.110</bibl>). <name  type='person'>Pamphillus</name> then suggested that the matter be placed in the hands of the Council, but that should the Council fail to deal with the two men, the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> should consider witholding the Council’s honorarium (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δωρεά</foreign>) at the end of their year of service (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:111' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.111</bibl>). The account continues, <quote >After this, when the Council had returned to the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>, they expelled him on the preliminary ballot, but took him back on the final vote</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:112' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.112</bibl>). The matter-of-fact way in which <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> reports this post-<term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> meeting of the Council suggests that it was not an extraordinary event, but a regular one.</p>

<p >The Council could meet in various locations. Inscriptional evidence shows that the Council might meet near the naval docks in <placeName  key='Piraeus'>Piraeus</placeName>, or by the harbor wall if it was discussing naval matters (<bibl  n='IG 1.3 61.53'><title >IG</title> I<edition >3</edition> 61.53</bibl>); <bibl  n='IG 2.2 1629.248'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 1629.248</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Andocides</name> says that he and <name  type='person'>Cephisius</name> were summoned to appear before the Council in the <name  n='Eleusinium, Eleusis' type='site'>Temple of <name  type='god'>Demeter</name></name> at <placeName  key='Eleusis'>Eleusis</placeName>, the <name  n='Eleusinium, Eleusis' type='site'>Eleusinium</name>, <quote >as it was there that the Council was to sit in conformity with a law of <name  type='person'>Solon</name>’s, which lays down that a sitting shall be held in the <name  n='Eleusinium, Eleusis' type='site'>Eleusinium</name> on the day after the Mysteries</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001:111' type='cts-urn'>Andoc. 1.111</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name> mentions one occasion on which, <quote >The Council of the Athenians happened to be meeting on the <name  n='Acropolis, Athens' type='site'>Acropolis</name></quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τῶν δὲ Ἀθηναίων ἡ βουλὴ ἐτύγχανεν ἐν ἀκροπόλει καθημένη</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg001:6.4.20' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Hell.</title> 6.4.20</bibl>).</p>

<p >But normally the Council met in the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>, the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Bouleuterion</name> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλευτήριον</foreign>), in the <name  n='Agora, Athens' type='site'>Agora</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg025:23' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 25.23</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.1</bibl>; <bibl  n='IG 2.2 330.30-31'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 330.30-31</bibl>).</p>

<p >Inside the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name> the Councilors were seated on benches, with special benches for the Presidents (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg013:37' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 13.37</bibl>). There was a raised platform for speakers, the <soCalled >bema</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βῆμα</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006:40' type='cts-urn'>Antiph. 6.40</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Antiphon</name> also says that, <quote >In that very <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name> was a shrine to <name  type='god'>Zeus</name> the Councilor <note  place='inline' resp='CWB' type='reference'><name  type='god'>Zeus Boulaios</name></note> and Athene the Councilor <note  place='inline' resp='CWB' type='reference'><name  type='god'>Athene Boulaia</name></note></quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ βουλευτηρίῳ Διὸς βουλαίου καὶ Ἀθηνᾶς βουλαίας ἱερόν ἐστι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006:45' type='cts-urn'>Antiph. 6.45</bibl>).</p>

<p >There was also a hearth (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἑστία</foreign>) sacred to <name  type='god'>Hestia</name> of the Council, or <name  type='god'>Hestia Boulaia</name>. We hear of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> affirming his praise for a returning embassy by swearing to this goddess in the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002:45' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 2.45</bibl>). But the sacred hearth was more broadly useful. As an altar to a god, it provided protection to whomever stood on it.</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Andocides</name> describes one instance of this. The context is a speech related to a scandal in <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> in <date  when='-0415'>415 BCE</date> (source for date: <bibl  n='OCD3' type='secondary'><title >OCD</title><edition >3</edition></bibl>); a number of Athenians, the general <name  type='person'>Alcibiades</name> most prominent among them, were accused of performing a parody of the Eleusynian Mysteries in a private residence (the scandal and subsequent legal actions are described at: <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001:6.28' type='cts-urn'>Thuc. 6.28</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001:6.53' type='cts-urn'>Thuc. 6.53</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg015:18.3' type='cts-urn'>Plut. <title >Alc.</title> 18.3</bibl>). The scandal provoked a crisis so great that the Council was granted special authority to conduct the investigation—<name  type='ancientAuthor'>Andocides</name> says, of the Council at this time, <quote >it had full powers</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἦν γὰρ αὐτοκράτωρ</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001:15' type='cts-urn'>Andoc. 1.15</bibl>). During the investigation, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Andocides</name> tells us, a certain <name  type='person'>Diocles</name> gave to the Council a list of forty-two Athenians whom he had seen at this mock ceremony: <quote >and at the head of the forty-two appeared <name  type='person'>Mantitheus</name> and <name  type='person'>Apsephion</name> who were members of the Council and present at that very meeting. <name  type='person'>Peisander</name> hereupon rose and moved that the decree passed in the archonship of Scamandrius be suspended and all whose names were on the list sent to the torture wheel, to ensure the discovery of everyone concerned before nightfall. The Council broke into shouts of approval. At that <name  type='person'>Mantitheus</name> and <name  type='person'>Apsephion</name> took sanctuary on the hearth, and appealed to be allowed to furnish guarantees and stand trial, instead of being tortured. They finally managed to gain their request; but no sooner had they provided their guarantees than they leapt on horseback and deserted to the enemy</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001:43-44' type='cts-urn'>Andoc. 1.43-44</bibl>). These two members of the Council invoked the protection of <name  type='god'>Hestia</name>, to prevent their fellow Councilors from forcing them to submit to torture—the fact that the <quote >all powerful</quote> Council was willing to suspend the decree that prohibited torturing Athenian citizens shows how seriously they took this crisis. And the protection of <name  type='god'>Hestia</name> worked, although <name  type='person'>Mantitheus</name> and <name  type='person'>Apsephion</name> did not live up to their promise to stand trial but fled the city.</p>

<p >The Hearth in the Council-chamber saved the life of the speaker in another speech by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Andocides</name>, during a turbulent meeting of the Council: <quote >I saw the uproar into which the meeting was breaking, and knew that I was lost; so I sprang at once to the hearth and laid hold of the sacred emblems. That act, and that alone, was my salvation at the time; for although I stood disgraced in the eyes of the gods, they, it seems, had more pity on me than did men; when men were desirous of putting to death, it was the gods who saved my life</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg002:15' type='cts-urn'>Andoc. 2.15</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name> records how, during the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Tyranny of the Thirty</term>, <name  type='person'>Theramenes</name> tried to invoke this protection in the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>. <name  type='person'>Critias</name>, one of the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty Tyrants</term>, had moved to strike <name  type='person'>Theramenes</name> from the roll of those enjoying citizen rights under the tyranny; <name  type='person'>Theramenes</name> stood on the hearth in the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name> and called on the Councilors to protect his rights. He invoked the sanctity of the hearth to highlight the impiety of the tyrants: <quote >To be sure, I know that this hearth will not help me, but I want to show that these <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty</term> are not only unjust toward men, but I want to show that they are are most impious toward the gods</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg001:2.3.53' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Hell.</title> 2.3.53</bibl>). As <name  type='person'>Theramenes</name> predicted, the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty</term> did not honor <name  type='god'>Hestia</name>’s shrine, and <name  type='person'>Critias</name> ordered that he be arrested: <quote >When <name  type='person'>Critias</name> had spoken these words, <name  type='person'>Satyrus</name> dragged <name  type='person'>Theramenes</name> away from the altar, and his servants lent their aid. And <name  type='person'>Theramenes</name>, as was natural, called upon gods and men to witness what was going on. But the Councilors kept quiet…</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg001:2.3.55' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Hell.</title> 2.3.55</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name> uses the tyrants’ failure to honor the sanctity of the Hearth to illustrate the depravity of the tyranny. Thus, even this negative example of the role played by <name  type='god'>Hestia Boulaia</name> shows us the importance of the goddess and her Hearth for the functioning of the democratic Council.</p>

<p >This anecdote shows both the impiety of the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty Tyrants</term> and the extent to which they had cowed the Council into submission, but also illustrates an important function of the <name  type='god'>Hestia Boulaia</name>.</p>

<p >The Presidents were responsible for summoning the Council to meet (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg018:169' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 18.169</bibl>; <bibl  n='IG 2.2 1629.247-251'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 1629.247-251</bibl>).

<p >In the early years of the Athenian democracy, the Presidents (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πρυτάνεις</foreign>) and their Chairman (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐπιστάτης</foreign>) presided over the conduct of Council meetings (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0009.tlg010:674' type='cts-urn'>Aristoph. <title >Kn.</title> 674</bibl>; <bibl  n='IG 2.2 50; IG I(3) 196'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 50</bibl>; <bibl  n='IG 1.3 196'><title >IG</title> I<edition >3</edition> 196</bibl>). But in the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century</date>, meetings were run by a different panel of officials. The Chairman would select by lot (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κληροῖ</foreign>) a board of nine Proedroi (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>προέδροι ἐννέα</foreign>), one Councilor from each of the nine tribes of Athens (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>φυλαί</foreign>), omitting the tribe whose Councilors were currently serving as Presidents (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath.

The Chairman would also select, from the nine Proedroi, one man to be Chairman of the Proedroi (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐπιστάτς τῶν προέδρων</foreign>), and would hand over the agenda to these men (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.2</bibl>).</p>

<p >The agenda naturally varied greatly from meeting to meeting, but there were certainly regularly recurring items. For example, people owing money to the Athenian state, on certain kinds of contracts—taxes, mining leases, etc. (see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:47.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 47.1</bibl>)—were supposed to make regular payments to the state, payable once in each Prytany (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:47.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 47.3</bibl>). So, the agenda for the first two meetings of the Council in each prytany included, as an item of business, the report of the <soCalled >ten Receivers</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἀποδέκται δέκα</foreign>), who would read their records of who had and had not made his payment (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.1-2</bibl>).</p>

<p >Also, an inscription from the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century</date> records a decree stipulating that once in each Prytany, the Council must meet to discuss what work was necessary to keep the harbor and walls in goo repair, and how to pay for the work: <quote >…the Council is to confer, on one meeting day during each Prytany, concerning wall-building</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὴν δὲ βουλὴν τὴν ἀεὶ βουλεύουσαν ἐν μίαν ἡμέραν τῆς πρυτανείας ἑκάστης βουλῆς ἕδραν περὶ τῶν τειχοποιικῶν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 244'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 244</bibl>).</p>

<p >Matters of foreign policy, which were not predictable, were often the subject of special meetings of the Council, with only one issue on the agenda (see for example <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg019:185' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 19.185</bibl>).</p>

<head >Procedure for Meetings</head>

<p >The Presidents summoned the Council into session, then handed the conduct of the meeting over to the nine Proedroi, chosen at random (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.2</bibl>). The Proedroi received the agenda (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πρόγραμμα</foreign>) from the Chairman, and as <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> says, <quote >they, having received the agenda, ensure good order, put forward matters of business to be discussed, count the hands for any vote, manage all other things, and they are empowered to dismiss the meeting</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>οἱ δὲ παραλαβόντες τῆς τ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??εὐκοσμίας ἐπιμελοῦνται, καὶ ὑπὲρ ὧν δεῖ χρηματίζειν προτιθέασιν, καὶ τὰς χειροτονίας κρίνουσιν, καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πάντα διοικοῦσιν, καὶ τοῦ τ᾽ ἀφεῖναι κύριοί εἰσιν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.3</bibl>).</p>

<p >During the two meetings in each prytany when the finances of Athens were on the agenda, it seems that the "Receivers" (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἀποδέκται</foreign>), rather than the Proedroi, were in charge of the meeting (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.2</bibl>). On other occasions, the Councilors were joined by other officials, such as the Board of the <term  sortKey='Theoric_Fund'>Theoric Fund</term>, the Treasurer of the Military Fund, the Auctions Board (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πωληταί</foreign>), or the nine Archons (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:47.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 47.2-48.1</bibl>).</p>

<p >Any Councilor could introduce a motion, but if the motion were later found to be illegal, that Councilor would be personally liable to indictment on a charge of <soCalled >Illegal Proposal</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:45.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath.

<p >Citizens who were not serving as Councilors could speak, with permission of the Presidents or the Proedroi (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0019.tlg005:907' type='cts-urn'>Aristoph. <title >Peace</title> 907</bibl>; <bibl  n='IG 1.3 46.35-39'><title >IG</title> I<edition >3</edition> 46.35-39</bibl>). A citizen could not introduce a motion into the meeting without arranging for a Councilor to sponsor the motion under his own name (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003:125' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 3.125</bibl>; <bibl  n='IG 2.2 243.6-8'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 243.6-8</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>, in his speeach against <name  type='person'>Ctesiphon</name>, accuses <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> of taking advantage of an inexperienced Councilor to have a motion of dubious legality introduced—the Councilor, after all, and not <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, would be liable to prosecution if the motion proved to be illegal (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003:125' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 3.125</bibl>).</p>

<p >At least in the <date  from='-0499' to='-0400'>5th century</date>, the Generals had the right to make motions in their own names, without having a Councilor sponsor the motion (<bibl  n='SEG 10 86.47'><title >SEG</title> 10 86.47</bibl>; <bibl  n='IG 2.2 27'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 27</bibl>).</p>


<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> mentions the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>, on an occasion when important news was being delivered to the Council, being <quote >full of private citizens</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὸ γὰρ βουλευτήριον μεστὸν ἦν ἰδιωτῶν</foreign>), which shows that citizens could sometimes attend meetings as spectators (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg019:17' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 19.17</bibl>; see also <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003:125' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 3.125</bibl>).</p>

<p >Foreigners could also attend meetings of the Council, but only with special permission. The inscription describing this privilege of <soCalled >access</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πρόσοδον</foreign>) is from the <date  from='-0499' to='-0400'>5th century</date>, so it specifies that permission must come from the Presidents; presumably, in the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century</date>, permission would have come from the Proedroi (<bibl  n='IG 1.3 65.17-20'><title >IG</title> I<edition >3</edition> 65.17-20</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name> tells, however, of an occasion when the Council refused to admit a herald from <placeName  key='Thebes'>Thebes</placeName> into their presence, so permission was by no means automatic (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg001:6.4.20' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Hell.</title> 6.4.20</bibl>).</p>

<p >Spectators were separated from the Councilors by a railing, and they probably had to stand, while the Councilors sat (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0009.tlg010:675' type='cts-urn'>Aristoph. <title >Kn.</title> 675</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg001:2.3.50' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Hell.</title> 2.3.50</bibl>).</p>

<p >There was a fence (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κιγκλίς</foreign>) around the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>, and when the Council was discussing any secret matter all spectators were kept outside the fence. Because of the fence, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, says, the Council <quote >is master of all their secrets, and no private citizens may enter</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τῶν ἀπορρήτων κυρίαν εἶναι, καὶ μὴ τοὺς ἰδιώτας ἐπεισιέναι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg025:23' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 25.23</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003:125' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 3.125</bibl>).</p>

<p >The Council voted on matters by show of hands (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>χειροτονία</foreign>), with the Proedroi judging the outcome (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κρίνουσι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.3</bibl>). When the business of the meeting was complete, the meeting was brought to a close by the Presidents (in the <date  from='-0499' to='-0400'>5th century</date>: <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0009.tlg010:674' type='cts-urn'>Aristoph. <title >Kn.</title> 674</bibl>), or by the Proedroi (in the 4th century: <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:44.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 44.3</bibl>).</p>

<p >Any motion that passed became a decree, and these Council decrees (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ψηφίσματα τῆς βουλῆς</foreign>) are the subject of the next sections.</p>
</div>


<div  n='DecreesGeneral' type='Section' xml:id='DecreesGeneral'>
<head >Council Decrees</head>

<p >The Council and the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> could both issue decrees (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ψηφίσματα</foreign>, in the plural; <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ψήφισμα</foreign> in the singular). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> refers to <quote >decrees of the Council and of the People</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὰ ψηφίσματα τὰ ἐκ τῆς βουλῆς καὶ τοῦ δήμου</foreign>) to refer to both kinds of decrees collectively (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg013:50' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 13.50</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> refers to <quote >the decrees of the People and of the Council of 500</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὰ ψηφίσματα τὰ τοῦ δήμου καὶ τῆς βουλῆς τῶν πεντακοσίων</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg019:179' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 19.179</bibl>). Many decrees were the work of both the Council and the <soCalled >People</soCalled> (that is, the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>); the texts of these would begin with the phrase, <quote >It seemed best to the Council and the People…</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἔδοξε τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῷ δήμῳ</foreign>) (see, for example, <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001:96' type='cts-urn'>Andoc. 1.96</bibl>).</p>

<p >When Athenian citizens were selected to serve as jurors, before taking their places in the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>court</term>, they swore an oath to abide by <quote >the laws and decrees of the People of Athens and of the Council of 500</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ψηφιοῦμαι κατὰ τοὺς νόμους καὶ τὰ ψηφίσματα τοῦ δήμου τοῦ Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῆς βουλῆς τῶν πεντακοσίων</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:149' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.149</bibl>). But it is important to note that decrees, whether of the People in the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> or of the Council, were not the same as laws. The orators make frequent reference to the legal principle that <quote >no decree, either of the Council or of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, shall have authority superior to a law</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg023:87' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 23.87</bibl>; see also <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001:87' type='cts-urn'>Andoc. 1.87</bibl>, <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001:89' type='cts-urn'>Andoc. 1.89</bibl>, where the principle is repeated almost word-for-word).</p>

<p >The process by which the Athenian democracy made laws is discussed in the article on <term  sortKey='Legislation'>Legislation</term>, and the Council’s role in that process is discussed below, in the section on <quote >The Council and the Nomothetae.</quote> But while the laws (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>νόμοι</foreign>) had authority over decrees (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ψηφίσματα</foreign>), much of the business of the Athenian democracy was conducted by means of decrees.</p>
</div>

<div  n='CouncilDecrees' type='Section' xml:id='CouncilDecrees'>
<head >Independent Action</head>

<p >In some circumstances, the Council could pass decrees that went into effect directly, without the participation of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. For example, a speech by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> deals with the case of a man named <name  type='person'>Theophemus</name>, who had served as trierarch (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τριήραρχος</foreign>), an official responsible for the upkeep of a warship. At the end of <name  type='person'>Theophemus</name>’ term, the speaker alleges, he failed to return some of the equipment that belonged to the ship. The speaker says that he brought this problem to the Council. He then approached <name  type='person'>Theophemus</name> and demanded the equipment, <quote >since now this decree had passed in the Council, and no one had charged it with illegality, and it had gone into effect</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>γενομένου τοίνυν τοῦ ψηφίσματος τούτου ἐν τῇ βουλῇ, καὶ οὐδενὸς γραφομένου παρανόμων, ἀλλὰ κυρίου ὄντος</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg047:33' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 47.33-34</bibl>). So in this case, the regulation of trierarchs, the Council’s decrees were immediately valid.</p>

<p >Inscriptions use special language to indicate that a decree came from the Council, as in the case of an inscription recording a Council decree establishing a special relationship between certain foreigners and the Athenian state: <quote >It seemed best to the Council, when the tribe of <name  n='Oineis' type='tribe'>Oineis</name> held the Presidency, and <name  type='person'>Dexippus</name> was secretary, and <name  type='person'>Democles</name> was Chairman, and <name  type='person'>Monippides</name> made the motion…</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἔδοξεν τῆι βολῆι· Οἰνηῒς ἐπρυτάνευε, Δεξίθεος ἐγραμμάτευε, Δημοκλῆς ἐπεστάτε· Μονιππίδης εἶπε·</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 6'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 6</bibl>). Because the inscription does says <quote >It seemed best to the Council,</quote> as opposed to "…to the Council and the People", we can conclude that this was another matter on which the Council could act independently.</p>

<p >A speech by the orator <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Isaeus</name> refers to decrees passed by the Council concerning an individual woman, who (according to the speaker) was not allowed to participate in certain religious rites because of reputation for scandalous behavior (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0017.tlg006:49' type='cts-urn'>Isaeus 6.49-50</bibl>).</p>

<p >A passage in <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Athenaeus</name> suggests that the Council could give itself a vacation by means of a Council decree: <quote >So that the Council might celebrate the Apaturia with the rest of the Athenians, according to the traditional ways, it has been decreed by the Council that the Councilors be dismissed for those days that the other offices have off, that is, five days starting from the day on which the Protenthae celebrate the opening feast of the Apaturia</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ὅπως ἂν ἡ βουλὴ ἄγῃ τὰ Ἀπατούρια μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων Ἀθηναίων κατὰ τὰ πάτρια, ἐψηφίσθαι τῇ βουλῇ ἀφεῖσθαι τοὺς βουλευτὰς τὰς ἡμέρας ἅσπερ καὶ αἱ ἄλλαι ἀρχαὶ αἱ ἀφεταὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς οἱ προτένθαι ἄγουσι πέντε ἡμέρας</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0008.tlg001:4.171e' type='cts-urn'>Athen. 4.171e</bibl>).</p>

<p >The Council could issue decrees regarding official embassies from <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> to other states. The orator <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> describes an embassy of which he was a member, and how its departure from <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> was delayed, and cites a decree of the Council as evidence supporting his assertion: <quote >As witness of this I will present the Council, for there is a decree of theirs which commands the ambassadors to set out in order to receive the oaths. Please read the decree of the Council</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>καὶ τούτου τὴν βουλὴν μάρτυρα ὑμῖν παρέξομαι· ἔστι γὰρ αὐτῆς ψήφισμα, ὃ κελεύει ἀπιέναι τοὺς πρέσβεις ἐπὶ τοὺς ὅρκους. καί μοι λέγε τὸ τῆς βουλῆς ψήφισμα.</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002:91' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 2.91</bibl>).</p>

<p >There is some evidence for more substantial decisions made by the Council alone. An inscription recording a <quote >treaty of military alliance between the <placeName  key='Eretria'>Eretrians</placeName> and the Athenians</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>Ἐρετριέων συμμαχία καὶ Ἀθηναίων</foreign>) begins with the phrase <quote >It seemed best to the Council</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἔδοξεν τῆι βολῆι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 16'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 16</bibl>). Had the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> been involved in this treaty, we would expect to see the phrase <quote >It seemed best to the Council and the People.</quote> Likewise, another inscription having to do with relationships between <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> and <name  type='person'>Dionysius</name>, tyrant of <placeName  key='Syracuse'>Syracuse</placeName>, also begins <quote >It seemed best to the Council</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἔδοξεν τῆι βολῆι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 18'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 18</bibl>).</p>

<p >Nevertheless, the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> of all Athenian citizens was the definitive institution of the democracy, and the democracy carefully guarded against giving the Council of 500 too much authority. Early in the <date  from='-0399' to='-0375'>4th century BCE</date>, the orator <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> expresses lingering suspicion about the Council and its role in the oligarchic coup of <date  when='-0411'>411 BCE</date> and the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Tyranny</term> imposed by the Spartans in <date  when='-0404'>404 BCE</date> (these events are described more fully in the article on the <term  sortKey='council_history'>history of the Council</term>): <quote >The Council which held session before the time of the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty</term> had been corrupted, and its appetite for oligarchy, as you know, was very keen. For proof of it you have the fact that the majority of that Council had seats in the subsequent Council under the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty</term>. And what is my reason for making these remarks to you? That you may know that the decrees issued by that Council were all designed, not in loyalty to you, but for the subversion of your democracy, and that you may study them as thus exposed</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg013:19' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 13.19-20</bibl>). According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name>, even in the period between the oligarchy and the tyranny, when <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> was democratic, the Council was dominated by Athenians who favored oligarchy.</p>

<p >It is not surprising, then, that the Council under the democracy had only limited authority to pass resolutions on its own, without the approval or cooperation of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. We have an inscription that lists various kinds of decisions that the Council was not allowed to make without getting the approval of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>; these include matters of war and peace, death sentences, especially large fines, stripping an Athenian of <term  sortKey='citizenship'>citizenship</term>, and perhaps (the inscription’s fragmentary state makes this uncertain) the administration of public finances and foreign policy (<bibl  n='IG 1.3 105'><title >IG</title> I<edition >3</edition> 105</bibl>).</p>

<p >Often, it seems, the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> would pass a broad decree, and leave management of the details to the Council. So, a decree of the Council and the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἔδοξεν τῆι βουλῆι καὶ τῶι δήμωι</foreign>), recorded on an inscription dating to around <date  when='-0356'>356 BCE</date>, includes the provision that, <quote >If this decree should omit anything, the Council is authorized to act</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐὰν δέ του προσδεήηι τόδε τὸ ψήφισμα, τὴν βουλὴν κυρίαν εἶναι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 127.34-35 = Tod 157'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 127.34-35 = Tod 157</bibl>; source for date: <bibl  n='M.N. Tod, A Selection of Greek Historical Inscriptions, vol. 2 [Oxford, 1948] 168'>M.N. Tod, <title >A Selection of Greek Historical Inscriptions</title>, vol. 2 [Oxford, 1948] 168</bibl>). This decree, establishing an alliance between Athens and the kings of <placeName  key='Thrace'>Thrace</placeName>, <placeName  key='Illyria'>Illyria</placeName>, and <placeName  key='Paeonia'>Paeonia</placeName>, is also mentioned at <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg019:86' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 19.86</bibl>.</p>

<p >Another inscription also gives the Council the right to manage details by decree, but with more cautious language. The decree of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, in <date  when='-0325'>325</date> or <date  when='-0324'>324 BCE</date>, has to do with the Athenian fleet and a colony that the Athenians were sending out to the <placeName  key='Adriatic'>Adriatic</placeName> sea (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>περὶ τῆς εἰς τὸν Ἀδρίαν ἀποικίας</foreign>). Here, the decree grants the Council limited powers to manage details, but only within the terms established by the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>: <quote >Should this decree regarding the expedition omit anything, the Council is authorized to issued decrees, as long as it does not violate any of the decrees passed by the People</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐὰν δέ τοῦ προσδέει τόδε τὸ ψήφισμα τῶν περὶ τὸν ἀπόστολον, τὴν βουλὴν κυρίαν εἶναι ψηφίζεσθαι μὴ λύουσαν μηθὲν τῶν ἐψηφισμένων τῶι δήμωι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 1629.264-9 = Tod 200'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 1629.264-9 = Tod 200</bibl>; source for date: <bibl  n='M.N.

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> notes another, special, circumstance in which the Council could act without involving the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. He describes an instance when all of the regularly scheduled meetings of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> in one month had passed, but there was still a need for a decree authorizing an embassy to depart from <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> to meet with <name  type='person'>Philip</name> of <placeName  key='Macedon'>Macedon</placeName>: <quote >Finding that you had got to the end of the regular <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assemblies</term>, and that there was no meeting left, and observing that the envoys were still wasting time at <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> instead of starting at once, I proposed a decree as a member of the Council, to which the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> had given authority, directing the envoys to sail immediately, and the general <name  type='person'>Proxenus</name> to convey them to any place in which he should ascertain that <name  type='person'>Philip</name> was to be found. I drafted it, as I now read it, in those express terms</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg019:154' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 19.154</bibl>).

<head >Introduction to Probouleumata</head>

<p >More important than any other function of the Council was its role in preparing the agenda for meetings of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, where all Athenian citizens gathered to discuss and vote on decrees.</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plutarch</name> describes the historical foundations of this role, which he says dates back to the time of <name  type='person'>Solon</name>, who established a body of laws for <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> in the <date  from='-0599' to='-0500'>6th century BCE</date>, before the classical Democracy was in place (see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg007' type='cts-urn'>Plut. <title >Sol.</title></bibl>). Regarding <name  type='person'>Solon</name>’s version of the Council, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plutarch</name> says: <quote >After he had established the Council of the <term  sortKey='Areopagus'>Areopagus</term>, consisting of those who had been archons year by year (and he himself was a member of this body since he had been archon), he observed that the common people were uneasy and bold in consequence of their release from debt, and therefore established another council besides, consisting of four hundred men, one hundred chosen from each of the four tribes. These were to deliberate on public matters before the people did, and were not to allow any matter to come before the popular <term  sortKey='Assembly'>assembly</term> without such previous deliberation.</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>συστησάμενος δὲ τὴν ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ βουλὴν ἐκ τῶν κατ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἐνιαυτὸν ἀρχόντων, ἧς διὰ τὸ ἄρξαι καὶ αὐτὸς μετεῖχεν, ἔτι δ᾽ ὁρῶν τὸν δῆμον οἰδοῦντα καὶ θρασυνόμενον τῇ τῶν χρεῶν ἀφέσει, δευτέραν προσκατένειμε βουλήν, ἀπὸ φυλῆς ἑκάστης, τεττάρων οὐσῶν, ἑκατὸν ἄνδρας ἐπιλεξάμενος, οὓς προβουλεύειν ἔταξε τοῦ δήμου καὶ μηδὲν ἐᾶν ἀπροβούλευτον εἰς ἐκκλησίαν εἰσφέρεσθαι.</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg007:19.1' type='cts-urn'>Plut. <title >Sol.</title> 19.1</bibl>).</p>

<p >So <name  type='person'>Solon</name>’s Council was intended to reduce the <quote >uneasiness</quote> and <quote >boldness</quote> of the Athenian people, by introducing an institution that mediated between the People and the decrees they might chose to pass. This was the role that the Council of the 500 played in the democracy as well.</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> says that the Council originally had sovereign power over many aspects of the democracy (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:45.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 45.1-3</bibl>), but after the Council condemned a man named <name  type='person'>Lysimachus</name> to death, without the benefit of a trial by jury, the Athenian people rescued the man and limited most of the powers of the Council. <quote >In these matters therefore the Council is not sovereign, but it prepares resolutions for the People, and the People cannot pass any measures that have not been prepared by the Council and published in writing in advance by the Presidents; for the proposer who carries such a measure is automatically liable to penalty by indictment for Illegal Proposal</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τούτων μὲν οὖν ἄκυρός ἐστιν ἡ βουλή· προβουλεύει δ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??εἰς τὸν δῆμον, καὶ οὐκ ἔξεστιν οὐδὲν ἀπροβούλευτον οὐδ᾽ ὅ τι ἂν μὴ προγράψωσιν οἱ πρυτάνεις ψηφίσασθαι τῷ δήμῳ. κατ᾽ αὐτὰ γὰρ ταῦτα ἔνοχός ἐστιν ὁ νικήσας γραφῇ παρανόμων</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:45.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 45.4</bibl>; for discussion of indictment for <soCalled >Illegal Procedure</soCalled>, see <term  sortKey='Legislation'>Legislation</term>).</p>

<p >The Council would vote on <soCalled >preliminary decrees</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>προβουλεύματα</foreign>, or in the singular, <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>προβούλευμα</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg023:92' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 23.92</bibl>). According to the <date  from='0900' to='0999'>10th century CE</date> lexicon of the Greek language, the <title >Suda</title>, a <soCalled >probouleuma</soCalled> was <quote >What has been voted on by the Council before being presented to the People</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg9010.tlg001:pi.2349' type='cts-urn'>Suda pi,2349</bibl>). A passage from the orator <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’ speech against <name  type='person'>Neaira</name> illustrates how a probouleuma worked:</p>

<p ><quote >You were at that time on the point of sending your entire force to <placeName  key='Euboea'>Euboea</placeName> and <placeName  key='Olynthus'>Olynthus</placeName>, and <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>, being one of its members, brought forward in the Council a motion, and carried it as a preliminary decree (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>προβούλευμα</foreign>) to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, proposing that the people should decide whether the funds remaining over from the state’s expenditure should be used for military purposes or for public spectacles. For the laws prescribed that, when there was war, the funds remaining over from state expenditures should be devoted to military purposes, and Apollodorus believed that the people ought to have power to do what they pleased with their own; and he had sworn that, as member of the Council, he would act for the best interests of the Athenian people, as you all bore witness at that crisis</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg059:4' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 59.4</bibl>).</p>

<p >In this case, an existing law required that any surplus funds in the treasury of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> should be used for military purposes. But despite this law, <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> wanted the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> to discuss how to spend the funds. So <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> brought the matter to the Council, which voted to create a preliminary decree. The council approved the preliminary decree. This preliminary decree allowed the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> to discuss how to spend the money. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> goes on to say that the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> voted, unanimously, to spend the money on the military (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg059:5' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 59.5</bibl>).</p>

<p >So, after this lengthy procedure, the Athenian democracy did with its money precisely what an existing law required. But the mechanism of the Council, its <term >probouleuma</term> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>προβούλευμα</foreign>), and the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> allowed all of the citizens to deliberate, in an orderly manner, on the extent to which the existing law was appropriate under these circumstances, a war in <placeName  key='Euboea'>Euboea</placeName> and around <placeName  key='Olynthus'>Olynthus</placeName>.</p>

<p >On this one inscription we see the whole legislative process. In the first prytany of the year, <name  type='person'>Antidotos</name>, a councillor, made a motion before the Council regarding this request by the Citians. One of the Proedroi in charge of running the meeting of the Council put the matter to a vote.

<head >Exceptional Decrees</head>

<p >In one of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’ speeches, we can see that there could be disagreement over the absolute necessity of a preliminary decree from the Council, before any business could be discussed in the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. The issue at <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg022:5' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 22.5</bibl> was whether the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> could vote a gift of thanks to the members of the Council at the end of their year of service. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> claims that a certain <name  type='person'>Androtion</name> has defended the practice of voting for such an award, in the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, without first getting a Preliminary Decree on the matter from the Council. It is not hard to see why this would seem reasonable—it would surely be awkward to ask the Council to pass a decree awarding a gift of thanks to itself. But, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> argues, that is precisely what <emph >should</emph> happen: <quote >There is one plea which he thinks a clever defence of the omission of the Preliminary Decree. There is a law, he says, that if the Council by its performance of its duties seems to deserve a reward, that reward shall be presented by the People <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>i.e. the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term></note>. That question, he says, the chairman of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> put, the People voted, and it was carried. In this case, he says, there is no need of a Preliminary Decree, because what was done was in accordance with law. But I take the exactly contrary view—and I think you will agree with me—that the Preliminary Decrees should only be proposed concerning matters prescribed by the laws, because, where no laws are laid down, surely no proposal whatever is admissible</quote><bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg022:5' type='cts-urn'> (Dem. 22.5).</bibl></p>

<p >So, if there was already a law (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>νόμος</foreign>) allowing the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> to do something, did the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> nevertheless need a Preliminary Decree? <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> says so, and it does make sense. The law might make it legal for the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> to award the Council a gift of thanks from time to time, but it remained to be decided whether such a gift was appropriate in any given year. That decision could only be made through discussion in the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, and such discussion could problably not take place without a Preliminary Decree from the Council.</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> goes on to note that in previous years the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> had voted awards to the Council without a preliminary decree (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg022:6' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 22.6</bibl>), but condemns that historical precedent as being illegal. It is very likely that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> is correct—that such an action in the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> was unconstitutional—but that no member of the Council would be so churlish as to object to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>’s voting them a gift of thanks, even without a <term >Probouleuma</term>.</p> 

<p >When <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> describes meetings of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, he mentions certain regular pieces of business that were to be conducted at each <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κυρία ἐκκλησία</foreign>, that is, each of the four regular meetings that took place during each prytany (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.4</bibl>); this business included votes of confidence in officials, matters of the food supply and security, a public invitation for any citizen to make certain kinds of accusations, and various public announcements (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.5' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.5-6</bibl> also specifies other regular business that was supposed to take place only once a year).</p>

<p >We do not know whether this business was an exception to the rule that <quote >nothing is permitted <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>to happen in the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term></note> without a Preliminary Decree from the Council</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>οὐκ ἔξεστιν οὐδὲν ἀπροβούλευτον</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:45.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 45.4</bibl>). Perhaps these were exceptions to that rule that allowed ordinary citizens to participate, in certain ways, in the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> without needing the intervention of the Council. Or, perhaps the Council automatically included these orders of business when it drew up the agendas for those regular meetings of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>.</p>

<p >Since <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> mentions these regularly occuring pieces of business for the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.4-5</bibl>) immediately after describing how the Council’s job was to prepare the agenda for meetings of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.4</bibl>), it seems more likely that the Council automatically put that business on the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>’s agenda.</p>

<p >Two of these regular items of business that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> mentions are particularly important for the democratic governance of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>. First, he mentions that, at one meeting of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> during each prytany, there was supposed to be the opportunity <quote >on that day for whoever wished to make public accusations</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὰς εἰσαγγελίας ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοὺς βουλομένους ποιεῖσθαι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.4</bibl>). And in the sixth prytany, at one of the meetings of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, there was supposed to be an opportunity for people to bring <quote >accusations against people, either Athenians or resident foreigners, informing on others maliciously (not more than three accusations against Athenians and three against foreigners), and and against anyone who promised to do something for the People but did not do it</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>καὶ συκοφαντῶν προβολὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν μετοίκων μέχρι τριῶν ἑκατέρων, κἄν τις ὑποσχόμενός τι μὴ ποιήσῃ τῷ δήμῳ</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.5' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.5</bibl>). And at one meeting (<name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> does not say which one) there was the opportunity <quote >for supplications, in which whoever wants to may place a suppliant-branch [<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἱκετηρίαν</foreign>] and make a request of the People regarding whatever he wishes, either public business or private business</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ταῖς ἱκετηρίαις, ἐν ᾗ θεὶς ὁ βουλόμενος ἱκετηρίαν, ὑπὲρ ὧν ἂν βούληται καὶ ἰδίων καὶ δημοσίων, διαλέξεται πρὸς τὸν δῆμον</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:43.6' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 43.6</bibl>). <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>The business of supplication is discussed at greater length in the article on the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>.</note></p>

<p >By having these as regular orders of business at pre-determined points in the year, the Athenian democracy allowed its citizens to make public complaints about citizens acting illegally or failing to live up to their responsibilities, to lodge complaints against citizens or foreigners misusing the court system, or simply make a request of the democratic government. But while most business had to go to the Council before appearing before the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, in at least these matters citizens had guaranteed access to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, without having to seek special permission from the Council.</p>
</div>

<div  n='ProbouleumataDenied' type='Section' xml:id='ProbouleumataDenied'>
<head >Probouleumata Voted Down</head>

<p >Because, in other matters, the Council could, and did, occasionally refuse to approve a <term >probouleuma</term>, it was important to guarantee citizens’ access to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, so they could make accusations against those abusing or wrongly manipulating the system.</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Herodotus</name> describes one such occasion, from the early <date  from='-0499' to='-0400'>5th century</date>, that was particularly dramatic. In <date  when='-0479'>479 BCE</date>, the Persians invaded <placeName  key='Greece'>Greece</placeName> and occupied <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>; the Athenians had evacuated the city and had taken refuge on the island of <placeName  key='Salamis'>Salamis</placeName> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001:9.3.2' type='cts-urn'>Hdt. 9.3.2</bibl>; source for date: <bibl  n='OCD3' type='secondary'><title >OCD</title><edition >3</edition></bibl>). The Persian general <name  type='person'>Mardonius</name> sent an envoy to the Council of the Athenians, which was still conducting business on the island. This envoy, a man named <name  type='person'>Murychides</name> from the <placeName  key='Hellespont'>Hellespont</placeName>, asked if the Athenians would surrender to <name  type='person'>Persia</name> now that their city was occupied (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001:9.5.1' type='cts-urn'>Hdt. 9.5.1</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Herodotus</name> describes what happened when the Councilors heard the Persian proposal:</p>

<p ><quote >Then <name  type='person'>Lycidas</name>, one of the Councilors, said that it seemed best to him to receive the offer brought to them by <name  type='person'>Murychides</name> and lay it before the People <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>that is, the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term></note>. This was the opinion which he declared, either because he had been bribed by <name  type='person'>Mardonius</name>, or because the plan pleased him. The Athenians in the Council were, however, very angry; so too were those outside when they heard of it. They made a ring round <name  type='person'>Lycidas</name> and stoned him to death. <name  type='person'>Murychides</name> the Hellespontian, however, they permitted to depart unharmed. There was much noise at <placeName  key='Salamis'>Salamis</placeName> over the business of <name  type='person'>Lycidas</name>; and when the Athenian women learned what was afoot, one calling to another and bidding her follow, they went on their own impetus to the house of <name  type='person'>Lycidas</name> and stoned to death his wife and his children</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001:9.5.1' type='cts-urn'>Hdt. 9.5.1-3</bibl>).</p>

<p >This story shows us several interesting things. First, that even under these extraordinary circumstances—the city occupied and in flames, the Athenians as refugees on a small island—the mechanisms of the Athenian democracy continued to function in a (more-or-less) orderly fashion. The envoy came to the Council, which was normal (the Council’s role in foreign policy is described below). A Councilor proposed a Preliminary Decree which would allow the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> to discuss the proposal. The Council rejected the proposed probouleuma. At this point, the normal functioning of the democracy broke down, no doubt because of the difficult circumstances and high emotions. The Councilors, and others, were not merely satisfied with voting down <name  type='person'>Lycidas</name>’ motion, but stoned the man to death—a violent equivalent to a prosecution for <soCalled >illegal motion</soCalled>.</p>

<p >It is worth mentioning that the orator <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lycurgus</name>, when describing these events, is careful to note that the Councilors removed the wreaths from their heads before stoning <name  type='person'>Lycidas</name> to death (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0034.tlg001:122' type='cts-urn'>Lyc. 1.122</bibl>). If this is true, then the Councilors were being very careful to separate their actions as an angry mob from their duties as representatives of the democracy—even if this is an embelishment to the story, it shows that later Athenians wanted to emphasize that killing a Councilor for moving an unpopular probouleuma was <emph >not</emph> a legitimate course of action.</p>

<p >One other thing emerges from this story. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Herodotus</name> says that <quote >The Athenians in the Council were, however, very angry; so too were those outside when they heard of it</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001:9.5.2' type='cts-urn'>Hdt. 9.5.2</bibl>). Since citizens (and sometimes non-citizens) could often come to meetings of the Council as spectators, the Athenians generally would often know which matters of business were proposed as probouleumata, which were passed on to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, and which ones were not. So while the Council could prevent the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> from discussing some problem or issue by failing to approve a preliminary decree, they could not usually, prevent their fellow citizens from knowing of that issue’s existance.</p>

<p >The historian <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name> describes a similar incident, one slightly less extreme, from the last days of the Peloponnesian War, at the end of the <date  from='-0405' to='-0404'>5th century</date>. Then, when the Spartans has beseiged <name  type='person'>Athens</name> from land and sea, <quote >when <name  type='person'>Archestratus</name> said in the Council that it was best to make peace with the Lacedaemonians <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>that is, the Spartans</note> on the terms they offered—and the terms were that they should tear down a portion ten stadia long <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>slightly more than one mile</note> of each of the two <name  n='Long Walls, Athens' type='site'>Long Walls</name>—he was thrown into prison, and a decree was passed forbidding the making of a proposal of this sort</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg001:2.2.15' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Hell.</title> 2.2.15</bibl>). Since a step as momentous as surrendering and tearing down the walls would surely have required the approval of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, <name  type='person'>Archestratus</name> must have proposed that the Council approve a probouleuma on this issue. Not only did this proposal fail, but the Council made it illegal for anyone even to make such a proposal.</p>

<head ><soCalled >Open</soCalled> and <soCalled >Closed</soCalled> Probouleumata</head>

<p >Sometimes the Council would make a Preliminary Decree, a probouleuma, that gave the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> a real choice between several courses of action, an <soCalled >open</soCalled> probouleuma. At other times, the Council would make a specific recommendation to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, a <soCalled >concrete</soCalled> probouleuma.</p>

<p >For an example of an open probouleuma, in a speech to an Athenian jury, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> describes this Preliminary Decree that came before the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>: <quote >You were at that time on the point of sending your entire army to <placeName  key='Euboea'>Euboea</placeName> and <placeName  key='Olynthus'>Olynthus</placeName>, and <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>, being a member of the Council, brought forward in the Council a bill, and carried it as a Preliminary Decree to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>; the Preliminary Decree proposed that the People should decide whether the funds remaining over from the state’s expenditure should be used for military purposes or for public spectacles. For the laws prescribed that, when there was war, the funds remaining over from state expenditures should be devoted to military purposes, and Apollodorus believed that the people ought to have power to do what they pleased with their own.</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg059:4' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 59.4</bibl>). Here the Council presented the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> with two choices, but did not recommend which choice the People should make.</p>

<p >An even more dramatic example comes from <date  when='-0339'>339 BCE</date>, when <name  type='person'>Philip</name> of <placeName  key='Macedon'>Macedon</placeName> had captured the city of <name  type='person'>Elatea</name>. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> decribes what happened: <quote >Evening had already fallen when a messenger arrived bringing to the presiding Councilors the news that <placeName  key='Elatea'>Elatea</placeName> had been taken. They were sitting at supper, but they instantly rose from their meal, cleared the booths in the marketplace of their occupants, and unfolded the hurdles, while others summoned the generals and ordered the trumpeter to come. The commotion spread through the whole city. At daybreak on the next day the Prytanes summoned the Council to the Council House, and the citizens flocked to the place of assembly. Before the Council could introduce the business and prepare the agenda, the whole body of citizens had taken their places on the hill. The Council arrived, the presiding Councilors formally reported the intelligence they had received, and the courier was introduced. As soon as he had told his tale, the marshal put the question, Who wishes to speak? No one came forward.</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg018:169' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 18.169-170</bibl>).</p>

<p >On the morning that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> describes, then, the Council met quickly to pass a probouleuma. The orator does not tell us of its contents, but it certainly seems that the Council did not make any specific recommendations. Instead, it seems most likely that the probouleuma merely put the military crisis on the agenda of the special meeting of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, and that any citizen was welcomed to make a specific proposal (which none was ready to do, evidently).</p>

<p >A very clear example of a <soCalled >concrete</soCalled> Preliminary Decree comes from a speech by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> <emph >about</emph> <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>. According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> moved a probouleuma in the Council, which was then sent along to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, that made a very specific recommendation: <quote ><quote >The hieromnemon <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>an official envoy sent on embassies of a religous nature</note> of the Athenians,</quote> it says, <quote >and the pylagori <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>another religious envoy</note> who are at the time in office, shall go to <placeName  key='Thermopylae'>Thermopylae</placeName> and <placeName  key='Delphi'>Delphi</placeName> at the times appointed by our fathers</quote></quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003:126' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 3.126</bibl>). This was a specific proposal, for the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> either to accept or to reject. Other <soCalled >concrete</soCalled> probouleumata appear in the sources. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> mentions one that put the matter of selling naval equipment to Philip of Macedon; the probouleuma invited the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> either to make doing so a capital offense, or not (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg019:286' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 19.286</bibl>). </p>

<p >It may have been that even under a <soCalled >concrete</soCalled> Preliminary Decree, once the business was on the floor of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, citizens could propose alternative solutions to those suggested by the Council in the original probouleuma. A passage from a speech by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> suggests this (the details of the historical situation are not important here):</p>

<p ><quote >Amyntor in support of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> testifies that when the people were deliberating on the subject of the alliance with <name  type='person'>Philip</name>, according to the decree of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, in the second meeting of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, when no opportunity was given to address the people, but when the decrees concerning the peace and alliance were being put to vote, at that meeting <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> was sitting by the side of the witness, and showed him a decree, over which the name of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> stood written; and that he consulted him as to whether he should hand it to the presiding officers to put to vote; this decree contained the terms on which <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> moved that peace and alliance he made, and these terms were identical with the terms which <name  type='person'>Philocrates</name> had moved.</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002:167' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 2.167-168</bibl>)</p>

<p >Here is what seems to be happening in this passage. There was a meeting of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. One item on the agenda (thus having been the subject of a Preliminary Decree from the Council) was a peace treaty with <name  type='person'>Philip</name> of <placeName  key='Macedon'>Macedon</placeName>. Because <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> says that no one had the opportunity to address the People (that is, the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>), we can assume that this was a concrete probouleuma, one making a specific recommendation for the People either to approve or reject. But <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> had already written <emph >another</emph> decree (a <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ψήφισμα</foreign>, <soCalled >something to be voted on by the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term></soCalled>, not a probouleuma from the Council) and was debating whether to introduce it.</p>

<p >From this, it would seem that once a piece of business got to <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, the Athenian people could debate and vote on related suggestions made on the spot, not merely the course of action recommended by the Council.</p>
</div>

<div  n='ProbouleumataTimeLimit' type='Section' xml:id='ProbouleumataTimeLimit'>
<head >Expiration of Probouleumata</head>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> mentions a law that set an expiration-date of one year for any probouleuma that was not voted on by the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg023:92' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 23.92</bibl>). The circumstances of this piece of evidence, however, and the way <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> mentions it, are confusing. A man named Aristocrates, while serving as Councilor, had moved a probouleuma in the Council, awarding honors on a man named Charidemus (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg023:90' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 23.90</bibl>). Later, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> wrote a speech prosecuting Euthycles on a charge of <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign>, or <soCalled >illegal proposal</soCalled> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg023:100' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 23.100</bibl>). In his speech, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> anticipates the kinds of arguments Aristocrates might use to defend himself. At one point, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> says: <quote >I imagine that he will use the following argument, and that he will try very hard to mislead you on this point. The decree, he will urge, is invalid because it is merely a Preliminary Decree (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>προβούλευμα</foreign>) and the law provides that votes of the Council shall be in force for one year only; therefore, if you acquit him today, the commonwealth can take no harm in respect of his decree.</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg023:92' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 23.92</bibl>). In other words, Arisocrates will try to argue that he cannot be prosecuted for making an illegal motion, since the motion he made more than a year ago is no longer in force.</p>

<p >If we can take this as evidence, then it seems that under certain circumstances a probouleuma would fail to come up for discussion for more than a year after the Council passed it, and it would then expire.</p>

<div  n='Legislation' type='Section' xml:id='Legislation'>
<head >Legislation</head>

<p >The Council played an important role in the process of legislation, or <term  sortKey='Legislation'><soCalled >nomothesia</soCalled></term> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>νομοθεσία</foreign>). This is a complex subject, and this discussion of the Athenian Council is not the place to describe legislation in detail (for a more complete description, based on the ancient sources, see the article on <term  sortKey='Legislation'>Legislation</term>). But a short summary of the process will help, as we look at how the Council participated in making laws for the Athenian Democracy.</p>

<p >Athenians in the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century</date> were governed by laws (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>νόμοι</foreign>, or <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>νόμος</foreign> in the singular) and decrees (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ψήφισματα</foreign>, or <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ψήφισμα</foreign> in the singular). Decrees were passed by a vote of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, of the Council, or both. Laws came into being by a more complicated process. Laws took precedence over Decrees. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> says, <quote >No decree, either of the Council or the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> shall have more authority than a law</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ψήφισμα δὲ μηδὲν μήτε βουλῆς μήτε δήμου νόμου κυριώτερον εἶναι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg023:87' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 23.87</bibl>). Anyone who proposed a decree in the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> that contradicted an existing law was subject to prosecution on a charge of <soCalled >Illegal Proposal</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>γραφὴ παρανόμων</foreign>). Laws were passed through a process called <soCalled >nomothesia</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>νομοθεσία</foreign>) or <soCalled >legislation</soCalled>. Each year the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> met to discuss the current body of laws. Any citizen could propose a change in the laws, but could only propose the repeal of a law if he suggested another law to replace the repealed law. If the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> decided to change the laws, a board of <soCalled >Nomothetai</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>νομοθέται</foreign>) or <soCalled >legislators</soCalled> was selected to review and revise the laws.</p>

<p >When inscribed on stone for the permanent record, decrees begin with the formula, <quote >it was decided by the People,</quote> or, <quote >It was decided by the Council and the People</quote> (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 206 4-5'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 206 4-5</bibl>, <bibl  n='IG 2.2 206 28-30'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 206 28-30</bibl>; <bibl  n='IG 2.2 237.5'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 237.5</bibl>, <bibl  n='IG 2.2 237 31'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 237 31</bibl>); a law began with the formula, <quote >It was decided by the Nomothetae</quote> (<bibl  n='SEG 12 87.607'><title >SEG</title> 12 87.607</bibl>).</p>

<p >So, the Council was not responsible for actually making laws, but it was responsible for initating the process by which laws were made. At the first meeting of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> for the year, in the month of Hekatombaion, the Athenians held votes on the whole body of laws (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:20' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.20</bibl>; see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:23' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.23</bibl> where the month of Hekatombaion, or <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>῾Εκατομαίων</foreign> is specified). This is how <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> describes the process, which begins with and annual review of the existing laws:</p>

<p ><quote >In the first presidency and on the eleventh day thereof, in the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, the Herald having read prayers, a vote shall be taken on the laws, to wit, first upon laws respecting the Council, and secondly upon general statutes, and then upon statutes enacted for the nine <term  sortKey='Archons'>Archons</term>, and then upon laws affecting other authorities. Those who are content with the laws respecting the Council shall hold up their hands first, and then those who are not content; and in like manner in respect of general statutes. All voting upon laws shall be in accordance with laws already in force</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:20' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.20</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> continues his description of the annual review: <quote >If any law already in force be rejected on show of hands, the Prytaneis of the Council (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τοὺς πρυτάνεις</foreign>) in whose term of office the voting takes place shall appoint the last of the three meetings of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> for the consideration of laws so rejected. The Proedroi (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τοὺς προέδρους</foreign>) who preside by lot at the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> are required, immediately after religious observances, to put the question respecting the sessions of the Nomothetae (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τῶν νομοθετῶν</foreign>), and respecting the fund from which their fees are to be paid. The Nomothetae shall consist of persons who have taken the judicial oath</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:21' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.21</bibl>). The <soCalled >judicial oath</soCalled> was the oath that jurors swore before entering a courtroom (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:27' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.27</bibl>; a passage in <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:149' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.149-151</bibl>, purports to be the text of that oath).</p>

<p >The Prytaneis of the Council were charged with creating a Preliminary Decree that would allow the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> to begin the review of the laws. There were severe penalties for Councilors who failed to fulfill this duty: <quote >If the Prytaneis do not convene the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> according to the written regulations, or if the Proedroi do not put the question, each Prytanis shall forfeit one thousand drachmas of sacred money to <name  type='god'>Athene</name>, and each Proedros shall forfeit forty drachmas of sacred money to <name  type='god'>Athene</name></quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:22' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.22</bibl>).</p>

<p >The Council’s role was not complete, however, with the selection of legislators. <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:27' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.27</bibl> contains a decree that orders <quote >the Council to cooperate in the legislative process</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>συννομοθετεῖν δὲ καὶ τὴν βουλήν</foreign>) in the matter of convening the Nomothetae, which may mean only that the Council was to ensure that the business appeared on the agenda for the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. The Council did, however, also have a special <soCalled >legislative secretary</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>γραμματεύς ἐπὶ τοὺς νόμους</foreign>), who made copies of all laws, and attended all meetings of the Council; this suggests that the Council discussed proposals for legislation before sending them on to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:54.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath.

</div>

<div  n='Jurisdiction' type='Section' xml:id='Jurisdiction'>
<head >Jurisdiction</head>

<p >According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name>, in the early history of the Athenian Democracy, the Council had the power to impose fines, imprison people, and even order them executed; but, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> goes on to say, after the Council had condemned a certain <name  type='person'>Lysimachus</name> to death, the Athenians saved his life, and the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> decreed that only a <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>law-court</term> would have the power to execute (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:45.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 45.1</bibl>). While in the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century</date> it seems clear that the Council did not have complete power of life-and-death over Athenians, there is no particularly good evidence that it ever did. So, either <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> knew of some evidence that no longer survives, or his description of the early powers of the Council is inaccurate.</p>

<p >A law survives from the beginning of the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century</date> that lists limits to the Council’s authority (<bibl  n='IG 1.3 105'><title >IG</title> I<edition >3</edition> 105</bibl>): in matters of war and peace, death sentences, large fines, disenfranchisement (that is, loss of <term  sortKey='citizenship'>citizenship</term>), the administration of public finances, and foreign policy, the Council could not act without the approval of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> (although the surviving fragments of the law are not clear regarding these last two).</p>

<p >Nevertheless, the Council did play an important role in maintaining the health of the democracy, apart from its management of the agendas for meetings of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. Its job was to watch over the more important public officials of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>, to ensure that they were fit for their office and that they conducted their duties properly (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:45.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 45.2</bibl>).</p>

<p >The main process by which the Council watched over the officials of the Athenian democracy was <soCalled >Scrutiny</soCalled>, or <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δοκιμασία</foreign> (see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:59.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 59.4</bibl> for use of the noun). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> describes the Scrutiny of the Nine <term  sortKey='Archons'>Archons</term> (the six <soCalled >Lawgivers</soCalled>, or <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>θεσμοθέται</foreign>, plus <soCalled >The Archon</soCalled>, or <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἄρχων</foreign>, the <soCalled >King Archon</soCalled>, or <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἄρχον βασιλεύς</foreign>, and the <soCalled >Warlord</soCalled>, or <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>πολέμαρχος</foreign>), who were the most important officials of the democracy (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:55.1' type='cts-urn'>Arstot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 55.1-4</bibl>):</p>

<p ><quote >As to the officials designated the Nine <term  sortKey='Archons'>Archons</term>, the mode of their appointment that was originally in force has been stated before; but now the six Lawgivers and their clerk are elected by lot, and also the Archon, King Archon and Warlord, from each tribe in turn. The qualifications of these are first checked in the Council of Five Hundred, except the Clerk, but he is checked only in a <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>Jury-court</term>, as are the other officials (for all of them, both those elected by lot and those elected by show of hands, have their qualifications checked before they hold office), while the Nine Archons are checked in the Council and also again in a Jury-court. Formerly any official not passed by the Council did not hold office, but now there is an appeal to the Jury-court, and with this rests the final decision as to qualification. The questions put in examining qualifications are, first, <quote >Who is your father and to what deme does he belong, and who is your father’s father, and who is your mother, and who is her father and what is his deme?</quote> Then whether he has a Family <name  type='god'>Apollo</name> and Homestead <name  type='god'>Zeus</name>, and where these shrines are; then whether he has family tombs and where they are; then whether he treats his parents well, and whether he pays his taxes, and whether he has done his military service. And after putting these questions the officer says, Call your witnesses to these statements. And when he has produced his witnesses, the officer further asks, <quote >Does anybody wish to bring a charge against this man?</quote> And if any accuser is forthcoming, he is given a hearing and the man on trial an opportunity of defence, and then the official puts the question to a show of hands in the Council or to a vote by ballot in the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>Jury-court</term>; but if nobody wishes to bring a charge against him, he puts the vote at once; formerly one person used to throw in his ballot-pebble, but now all are compelled to vote one way or the other about them, in order that if anyone being a rascal has got rid of his accusers, it may rest with the jurymen to disqualify him.</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:55.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 55.1-4</bibl>)</p>

<p >This passage shows the role of the Council, and the limits of its authority. The Council conducted the Scrutiny of potential officials, but could not, by itself, deny them their office. If the Council disapproves a candidate, he had recourse to an appeal before a jury. This sentence needs some explanation: <quote >Formerly one person used to throw in his ballot-pebble, but now all are compelled to vote one way or the other about them, in order that if anyone being a rascal has got rid of his accusers, it may rest with the jurymen to disqualify him</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:55.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 55.4</bibl>). Evidently, at one time, if a candidate came up for approval, and no one spoke out against him, the Council (or jury, as the case may have been), conducted a symbolic vote, a mere formality, with one person only placing one vote in favor. Later, according to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name>, this was changed to require a serious vote, with all members participating; this would ensure that people could vote against a candidate secretly, in case they were afraid to speak out openly.</p>

<p >Perhaps more important even than the Scrutiny of officials was the Council’s Scrutiny of Young Men, the <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δοκιμασία τῶν ἐφήβων</foreign>. Young men could become citizens when they turned eighteen, if they were the legitimate sons of two Athenian citizens (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:42.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 42.1</bibl>). Young men would be inspected in their villages, initially, and added to the roles as new citizens if their fellow demesmen found that they met the requirements, but the final inspection of citizen-roles was the business of the Council, which conducted a Scrutiny of them to make sure that each was actually eighteen years old (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:42.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 42.2</bibl>). If the Councilors found that any candidates for <term  sortKey='citizenship'>citizenship</term> were too young, they would fine the members of the candidate’s deme who put him on the list (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:42.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 42.2</bibl>). After this Scrutiny, all these new candidates were sent off for two years of military training at the hands of selected instructors (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:42.3' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 42.3-4</bibl>).</p>

<p >Similiarly, the Concil conducted a <soCalled >Scrutiny of the Horses</soCalled>, a <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δοκιμασία τῶν ἵππων</foreign> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:49.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 49.1</bibl>). Athenians who were to serve as cavalry in wartime were listed on a roll (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:49.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 49.1</bibl>), and the state paid them a salary and pay for their horses’ feed. If the Councilors found that a horse was not in good condition, or that it was improperly trained, they could fine its owner to recover the cost of its feed and deny him his cavalry pay (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:49.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 49.1-2</bibl>).</p>

<p >The Council also conducted a <soCalled >Scrutiny of the Helpless</soCalled>, a <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δοκιμασία τῶν ἀδυνάτων</foreign> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:49.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 49.4</bibl>): <quote >The Council also inspects the Helpless; for there is a law enacting that persons possessing less than 3 minae and incapacitated by bodily infirmity from doing any work are to be inspected by the Council, which is to give them a grant for food at the public expense at the rate of 2 obols a day each.</quote> This function of the Council is well-attested. The orator <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> wrote a speech for a man defending his right to receive the pension due to the Helpless; the speech begins with an address, not to a jury (as so many speeches begin), but <quote >O Council</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ὦ βουλή</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg024:1' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 24.1</bibl>).</p>

<p >The Council’s role in this <soCalled >Scrutiny of the Helpless</soCalled> helps the orator <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> make an ironic point in his speech against <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1</bibl>). Among <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name>’ many personal failings (the orator claims), he abandoned his own uncle to poverty. According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>, <name  type='person'>Arignotus</name> was <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>’ uncle, an old blind man. <name  type='person'>Arignotus</name> had always received financial support from his brother, <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name>’ father, a wealthy man. But after the father died, and <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name> came to control the estate, <quote >he thrust aside this old and unfortunate man, his own uncle, and made way with the estate. He gave nothing to <name  type='person'>Arignotus</name> for his support, but was content to see him, fallen from such wealth, now receiving the alms that the city gives to disabled paupers. Finally, and most shameful of all, when the old man’s name had been omitted at a revision of the list of pauper-pensioners, and he had laid a petition before the Council to have his dole restored, the defendant, who was a member of the Council, and one of the presiding officers that day (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>βουλευτὴς ὢν καὶ προεδρεύων</foreign>), did not deign to speak for him, but let him lose his monthly pension</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:103' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.103-104</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>’ accusation against <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name> certainly seems damning: Not only did <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name> fail to perform his duty as the nephew to an old and infirm man, but he failed to perform his duty as a member of the Council by ensuring that one of the <soCalled >Helpless</soCalled> citizens, the <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἀδυνάτοι</foreign>, received support from the State.</p>

<p >This orator’s case against <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name> shows us another area of the Council’s jurisdiction. The Council could discipline its own members and expel them if they failed to act properly. According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>, <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name> was accused of corruption during his year as a Councilor. <quote >After this, when the Council had gone into the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>, they expelled him with the test-vote, but they excused him with the real vote. And it pains me to tell you, though I must say it <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> tells his audience</note>, that because the Council did not hand him over to the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>law-court</term>, nor did they expel him from the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>, you did not give them their end-of-year bonus (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δωρεᾶς</foreign>)</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:110' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.110-112</bibl>).</p>


<p >So here, the Council deliberated expelling a member, but failed to do so, and if <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> can be believed, that failure cost them their bonus from the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. This passage offers one other interesting insight into the working of the Council. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> says that the council, first, <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐξεφυλλοφόρησε μὲν αὐτόν</foreign>, <quote >voted him out with leaves,</quote> but later, <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐν δὲ τῇ ψήφῳ κατεδέξατο</foreign>, <quote >excused him during the pebble-vote</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:112' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 1.112</bibl>). So, it seems, that the Councilors would take test votes using leaves for ballots, but would use pebbles for the official vote. (<name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> also mentions the Council voting with pebbles, that is, a secret ballot, rather than by show of hands when it was acting like a jury: <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg047:42' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 47.42</bibl>). Note, too, that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>’ account suggests that <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name> would have had to go before a jury, if the Council had convicted him.</p>

<p >In addition to conducting Scrutiny of officials as they enter office, and of future citizens as they reach their eighteenth year, the Council could hear accusations that someone should be removed from office, or have his <term  sortKey='citizenship'>citizenship</term> revoked. In a speech written by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name>, the defendant has been accused of holding <term  sortKey='citizenship'>citizenship</term> under false pretenses. He addresses himself to <quote >Gentlemen of the Council,</quote> <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ὦ ἄνδρες βουλευταί</foreign>, and notes that he has already <quote >been found, on Scrutiny, to be of legal age</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἁνὴρ εἶναι ἐδοκιμάσθην</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg026:21' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 26.21</bibl>). Extra Scrutinies, beyond the regular ones, could be initiated at any time, either by a member of the Council calling for an investigation of an official (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0028.tlg006:49-50' type='cts-urn'>Antiph. 6.49-50</bibl>), or by any Athenian citizen denouncing someone by means of an <quote >accusation to the Council</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>εἰσαγγελία εἰς τὴν βουλήν</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:45.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath.

When someone brought such a charge to the Council, it would act like a jury-court, hearing arguments on both sides and voting with secret ballots (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg047:42' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 47.42-44</bibl>). In such cases, the Council’s decision was merely a preliminary verdict (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κατάγνωσις</foreign>), and the accused person could appeal to a <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>law-court</term> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:45.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 45.2</bibl>).</p>

<div  n='Punishment' type='Section' xml:id='Punishment'>
<head >Powers to Punish</head>

<p >Under a few select circumstances the Council had the authority to punish Athenians, or at least to order them held in prison until a trial before a jury. For example, the Athenian democracy <soCalled >out-sourced</soCalled> the collection of taxes to <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τελωνικοί</foreign>, or <soCalled >tax-farmers</soCalled>, men who paid for the right to collect taxes on behalf of the Athenians. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> suggests that the Council had special authority over these mean, and over others who owed money to the Athenian democracy:</p>

<p ><quote >You have a law in operation, as good a law as ever was enacted, that holders of sacred or civil moneys shall pay the money in to the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>, and that, failing such payment, the Council shall recover the money by enforcing the statutes applicable to tax-farmers;and on that law the administration of the treasury depends</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:95' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.95</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> goes on to hint, at least, that it was in the power of the Council to imprison public debtors like the ones he mentioned above: <quote >It follows that the whole business of the State must go to rack and ruin when, the payments on account of taxation being insufficient, there is a large deficiency, when that deficiency cannot be made up until towards the end of the year, and when, as regards the supplementary payments, neither the Council nor the law-courts have authority to imprison defaulters</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:98' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.98</bibl>). This passage does not come out and say that the Council could imprison public debtors, but thi ironic statement would certainly be more effective if that were the case.</p> 

<p >From earlier in the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century BCE</date>, a passage from the orator <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Andocides</name> gives more firm evidence that the Council had the power to imprison public debtors. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Andocides</name> tells the story of a certain <name  type='person'>Cephisius</name> thus:</p>

<p ><quote ><name  type='person'>Cephisius</name> here purchased from the state the right to collect certain public rents, and obtained thereby a return of ninety minae from the farmers occupying the lands concerned. He then defaulted; and since he would have been placed in prison had he appeared in <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>, since it was laid down by law that any defaulting tax farmer may be so punished by the Council, he retired into exile</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0027.tlg001:93' type='cts-urn'>Andoc. 1.93</bibl>).</p>

<p >It seems, though, that while the Council could imprison public debtors, that imprisonment was not actually their punishment, but a way to keep them in town until they could be tried before a jury. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> quotes a law that makes this clear:</p>

<p ><quote >Law: Moved by <name  type='person'>Timocrates</name>: if any Athenian citizens are now in jail or shall hereafter be imprisoned on impeachment by the Council, if the judgement against such prisoners be not delivered to the Judges by the Secretary of the Presidency in pursuance of the law of impeachment, be it enacted that the Eleven shall bring them before the Court within thirty days of the day on which they receive them into custody, unless prevented by public business, and, if so prevented, as soon as possible. Any Athenian qualified as a prosecutor may prosecute. If the culprit be convicted, the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>Court of Heliaea</term> shall assess such penalty, pecuniary or otherwise, as he appears to deserve. If the penalty assessed be pecuniary, he shall be imprisoned until he has paid the full amount of the fine inflicted</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:63' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.63</bibl>).</p>

<p >This law, if it is authentic (and it is important to remember that the laws quoted in Athenian orations are not always authentic), begins by assuming that some citizens have been imprisoned by the Council, and that some might be in the future. It goes on to limit the term of their imprisonment by setting time-limits for their trial before a jury. Their final punishment is up to the court of the <name  n='Heliaea, Athens' type='site'>Heliaea</name>.</p>

<p >Such a law would be in keeping with the nature of the Council of the 500 under the Athenian democracy. This institution was very powerful, and so was potentially dangerous. In this matter, as in others that we have seen, the Athenians seem to have been very careful to limit the Council’s power.</p>

<p >Further evidence of both the Council’s authority to imprison people under certain circumstances, and the careful limits that the Athenians placed on the Council’s power, comes from <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’ speech against <name  type='person'>Timocrates</name>. In this speech, we can see that the Council had the authority to imprison people accused of treason against <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> begins by quoting from the legal language of the Athenian democracy, without (at first) stating clearly what he is quoting:</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> quotes, <quote >Nor will I imprison any Athenian citizen who offers three sureties taxed in the same class as himself, except any person found guilty of conspiring to betray the city or to subvert popular government, or any tax-farmer or his surety or collector being in default</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:144' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.144</bibl>).</p>

<p >So that is the fragment of legal language. But where does it come from? <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> keeps his audience in suspence for a few more sentences, pausing to explain what it means:</p>

<p ><quote >This statute, gentlemen of the Jury, is not intended for the protection of people who have stood their trial and argued their case, but for those who are still untried and its purpose is that they shall not plead at a disadvantage, or even without any preparation at all, because they have been sent to jail</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:145' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.145</bibl>).</p>

<p >So the rule that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> quoted is merely intended to allow citizens who have been accused, but not tried, to get out on bail, as it were. Finally, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> tells his audience where this phrase comes from, and why it is important:</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> says that, <quote >the formula, <quote >I will not imprison any Athenian citizen,</quote> is not in itself a statute; it is merely a phrase in the written oath taken by the Council, to prevent politicians who are in the Council from caballing to commit any citizen to prison. Solon therefore, wishing to deprive the Council of authority to imprison, included this formula in the Councilors’ oath; but he did not include it in the judicial oath. He thought it right that a <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>Court</term> of Justice should have unlimited authority, and that the convicted criminal should submit to any punishment ordered by the court</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:146' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.146</bibl>).</p>

<p >So, according to this orator at least, <name  type='person'>Solon</name> himself, in the <date  from='-0599' to='-0500'>6th century BCE</date>, wrote this oath to limit the authority of the Council of 500; the Council could not hold people without bail, since only a (more democratic) <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>jury-court</term> should have that kind of power.</p>

<p >For our understanding of the Council’s authority, however, it is significant that this fragment of the Councilor’s Oath contains one exception: the Councilors swear not to imprison anyone without setting bail, <quote >except any person found guilty of conspiring to betray the city or to subvert popular government</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024:144' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 24.144</bibl>). So accused traitors could be held in confinment, by order of the Council, until their trial.</p>

<p >Finally, could the Council, on its own authority, put people to death without a trial? Two pieces of evidence suggest so, but they need to be read and considered carefully.</p>

<p >The first is from a speech written by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Isocrates</name>; the speaker is a man who is suing a banker, <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>, claiming that the banker defrauded him of all his money. At one point in the speech, the speaker claims that he had invested in a trading expedition, but that someone had made the accusation that the cargo of the ship was illegal merchandise. He says, <quote >When I disputed this claim and demanded that the ship put to sea, those who make a business of blackmail so influenced the Council that at first I almost was put to death without a trial; finally, however, they were persuaded to allow someone to post bail for me</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0010.tlg005:42' type='cts-urn'>Isoc. 17.42</bibl>).</p>

<p >This is the kind of evidence that makes the business of ancient history difficult. The speech, written by a resident of <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century</date> <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>, delivered by a resident of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> to an Athenian jury, says very clearly that he, the defendant, was in danger of having the Council put him to death without a trial. But was the speaker <emph >really</emph> in such danger, or is this merely a rhetorical device to build sympathy for himself? We should note that he was <emph >not</emph> in fact, put to death, but posted bail and was released. (Perhaps we can conclude that having something to do with a contraband cargo put this man in the same category as the public debtors, and so the Council had the authority to hold him until we was tried by a jury, unless he posted bail.)</p>

<p >And along with the problem of the speaker’s sincerity, there is the problem of consistency: given the many checks on the authority of the Council, does it seem likely that it would have the power to execute someone, without trial, on the matter of a ship’s cargo?</p>

<p >Different conclusions are possible, but most students of Athenian democracy would probably take the nature of the specific evidence (an offhand, rhetorical comment about what <soCalled >almost happened</soCalled>) and the majority of other evidence (which suggests that the Council’s authority to take final action, without the more democratic institutions of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> or the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>lawcourts</term>) and decide not to jump to any conclusions.</p>

<p >One other piece of evidence is more direct. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> describes how, after the Tyranny of the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty</term> had come to an end in the winter of <date  from='-0403' to='-0402'>403-402 BCE</date>, the Athenians went about restoring their democracy and trying to bring an end to the (inevitable) bitterness that threatened to divide the population. (The historical development of the Council, including its role in these events, is discussed in another <term  sortKey='council_history'>article</term>; for the Tyranny of the Thirty generally, see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg001:2.3' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Hell.</title> 2.3-4</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001:14.3' type='cts-urn'>Diod. 14.3-6</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001:14.32' type='cts-urn'>Diod. 14.32-33</bibl>; source for this date: <bibl  n='OCD3' type='secondary'><title >OCD</title><edition >3</edition></bibl>). During this critical time, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> says, a certain <name  type='person'>Archinus</name> acted skillfully to bring the population of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> back together; for example, he discouraged many of those who had supported the <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Thirty Tyrants</term> from emigrating from the city, keeping them in <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> until they saw that they were not to be persecuted (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:40.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 40.1</bibl>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> continues, <quote >This seems to have been a statesmanlike act of <name  type='person'>Archinus</name>; as was also later his indicting as unconstitutional the decree of <name  type='person'>Thrasybulus</name> admitting to <term  sortKey='citizenship'>citizenship</term> all those who had come back together from <placeName  key='Piraeus'>Piraeus</placeName>, some of whom were clearly slaves, and his third act of statesmanship was that when somebody began to stir up grudges against the returned citizens, he arraigned him before the Council and persuaded it to execute him without trial, saying that this was the moment for them to show if they wished to save the democracy and keep their oaths; for by letting this man off they would incite the others too, but if they put him out of the way they would make him an example to everybody</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:40.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 40.2</bibl>).</p>

<p >So these were the acts of <name  type='person'>Archinus</name> to preserve the Athenian people: he prevented mass emigration of a portion of the citizens; he prevented the wholesale enfranchisments, that is, the indiscriminate granting of <term  sortKey='citizenship'>citizenship</term> to anyone who had opposed the tyranny; and he persuaded the Council to execute, without trial, someone who was stirring up grudges against the supporters of the deposed <term  sortKey='Thirty_Tyrants'>Tyrants</term>. In short, <name  type='person'>Archinus</name>’ policy seems to have been to do whatever he could to erase the divisions among the people that had arisen from the Tyranny. Citizens were citizens, and slaves were slaves, regardless of which side anyone had supported in previous days.</p>

<p >This is direct and positive evidence for the Council executing someone without trial. But, as with the evidence from <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Isocrates</name>, this evidence requires careful consideration. Was execution-without-trial a normal privilege of the Council, or was it an extreme measure, technically illegal but (arguably) justified in this one extraordinary circumstance, when the city was trying to restore the rule of law after overthrowing a brutal tyranny? Again, the mass of evidence that we have, which shows how careful the Athenians limited the authority of the Council, would probably lead to the conclusion that, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name>’s account notwithstanding, the Council could not normally execute Athenian citizens without sending them to a democratic jury for a trial.</p>
</div>

<div  n='Administration' type='Section' xml:id='Administration'>
<head >Administration of Attica</head>

<p >Because the Council represented the largest institution of the Athenian democracy that existed on a full-time basis, with groups of fifty Councilors serving for an <soCalled >administrative month,</soCalled> or <soCalled >prytany,</soCalled> at a time, it made sense for this body to play a large role in the administration of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>. The Council was responsible for making the city work properly.</p>

<p >We have already seen that the Council was responsible for inspecting members of the cavalry and their horses (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:49.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 49.1-2</bibl>). The Council had additional responsibilities toward the military defenses of <placeName  key='Attica'>Attica</placeName> as well. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> mentions a law that required the Council to oversee the building of new warships; the law specified that the Councilors would not get their end-of-year bonus (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>δωρειά</foreign>) if they failed in this duty (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg022:8' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 22.8</bibl>).</p>

<p >A decree of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> survives on an inscription that is very specific about the Council’s responsibility toward the outfitting of the naval fleet. The decree orders certain individual citizens to take charge of the outfitting and dispatch of the fleet—these citizens were called <soCalled >Trierarchs</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τριήραρχος</foreign>)—but goes on to make the Council responsible for seeing that the job gets done (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 1629.233-266'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 1629.233-266</bibl>; much of this is echoed at <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:46.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 46.1</bibl>):</p>

<p ><quote >Should anyone, whether he be an official or a private citizen, not do any of the things he has been assigned by this Decree, let him owe ten thousand drachmas to the Treasury of <name  type='god'>Athene</name>, and let the Auditor and the Assessor mark down this obligation, or owe the fine themselves. And it is necessary for the Council to punish those of the Trierarchs who were responsible for the fleet but who shirked their duty. And the Prytaneis must make a session of the Council concerning the fleet, and it should meet continuously until the fleet is ready. And the People will choose ten men out of all the Athenians to be Naval Constructors, to take responsibility for the fleet, according to the instructions of the Council.

<p >This law not only shows the Council’s authority over the construction and dispatch of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>’ navy, but also illustrates, again, the separation of powers under the Athenian Democracy: the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> here delegates authority to the Council, but in the end it is the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> of the People that have the final word.</p>

<p >The Council was also responsible for keeping the harbor and naval yards in good repair (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:46.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath.

<div  n='Finance' type='Section' xml:id='Finance'>
<head >Public Finance</head>

<p >The Council was fully involved in almost every aspect of public finance under the Athenian democracy, from overseeing the collection of money, to managing its distribution where needed, to punishing those who failed to pay to the city what they owed or who misspent what they received from the city. Because the subject of public finance is so complicated, it deserves its own treatment as an aspect of Athenian Democracy, but in this discussion of the Council generally, it will be enough to suggest, through the primary sources, how the Council financed its own activities.</p>

<p >A writer in the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century BCE</date> wrote a tract about the Athenian democracy. This text was originally attributed to the writer <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name>, but since scholars no longer think that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name> actually wrote it, the author is called <soCalled ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Pseudo-Xenophon</name>,</soCalled> or the <soCalled >False Xenophon</soCalled>—because the tract is quite critical of the democracy at <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>, this author is sometimes called the <soCalled >Old Oligarch.</soCalled> One of the points of criticism he raises is the perceived inefficiency of the Athenian government, how long it can take for the Council or the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> to get around to hearing about any new business:</p>

<p ><quote >I notice also that objections are raised against the Athenians because it is sometimes not possible for a person, though he sit about for a year, to negotiate with the Council or the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. This happens at <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> for no other reason than that—owing to the quantity of business—they are not able to deal with all persons before sending them away. For how could they do this? First of all they have to hold more festivals than any other Greek city (and when these are going on it is even less possible for any of the city’s affairs to be transacted), next they have to preside over private and public trials and investigations into the conduct of magistrates to a degree beyond that of all other men, and the Council has to consider many issues involving war, revenues, law-making, local problems as they occur, also many issues on behalf of the allies, receipt of tribute, the care of dockyards and shrines. Is there accordingly any cause for surprise if with so much business they are unable to negotiate with all persons?</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg015:3.1' type='cts-urn'>Ps. Xen. <title >Const. Ath.</title> 3.1-2</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Pseudo-Xenophon</name>’s condensed list of the Council’s duties—<quote >war, revenues, law-making, local problems as they occur, also many issues on behalf of the allies, receipt of tribute, the care of dockyards and shrines</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg015:3.2' type='cts-urn'>Ps. Xen. <title >Const. Ath.</title> 3.2</bibl>)—can suggest how and why the Council was, inevitably, deeply involved in matters of public finance, both the acquiring and the spending of public money.</p>

<p >Under normal circumstances, the Council had its own money, a share of the public money, that was apportioned for the Council’s use by the Treasurers (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>οἱ ταμίαι</foreign>). So, for example, if the Council needed to arrange for a public stele, a stone with a decree inscribed on it, they could use their own budget to pay the inscriber, as this preserved decree shows: <quote >[The Council and the People decreed that] the Treasurers of the Council give 30 talants to the inscriber of this stele, from the funds apportioned to the Council</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐς δὲ τὴν ἀναγραφὴν τῆς στήλης δοῦναι τοὺς ταμίας τῆς βουλῆς 30 δραχμὰς ἐκ τῶν κατὰ ψηφίσματα ἀναλισκομένων τῆι βουλῆι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 120.20-22'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 120.20-22</bibl>).</p>

<p >Another example is this decree, preserved on an inscription, in which the Council has voted to honor a certain <name  type='person'>Eudodoxos</name> with a gold crown, costing 500 drachmas. The inscription specifies that, <quote >the Treasurers will give the silver [for the crown] from the money apportioned, according to the decrees, for the Council</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τοὺς δὲ ταμίας δοῦναι τὸ ἀργύριον ἐκ τῶν κατὰ ψηφίσματα ἀναλισκομένων τῆι βουλῆι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 223 FaceBLeft 10-16'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 223</bibl>).</p>

<p >Funds were not always sufficient, and this could lead to trouble. The orator <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Lysias</name> says, in one of his speeches, that <quote >the Council, whenever it deliberates, as long as it has enough money for its administration, never goes wrong; but whenever it gets into financial difficulties, it is forced to accept <term  sortKey='apophasis'>impeachments</term>, to confiscate the property of citizens, and to be persuaded by the arguments of the worst sort of orator</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἡ βουλὴ ἡ ἀεὶ βουλεύουσα, ὅταν μὲν ἔχῃ ἱκανὰ χρήματα εἰς διοίκησιν, οὐδὲν ἐξαμαρτάνει, ὅταν δὲ εἰς ἀπορίαν καταστῇ, ἀναγκάζεται εἰσαγγελίας δέχεσθαι καὶ δημεύειν τὰ τῶν πολιτῶν καὶ τῶν ῥητόρων τοῖς τὰ πονηρότατα λέγουσι πείθεσθαι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0540.tlg030:22' type='cts-urn'>Lys. 30.22</bibl>).</p>

<p >Since the Council had so much power and handled so much money, the Athenians were careful to ensure that it dealt honestly and openly. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name> describes the elaborate system of public accounting and accountability that accompanied the Council’s job of receiving and distributing funds.</p>

<p >For example, when an Athenian citizen held a lease on some public land, he made his payments to the Council once a year, in the ninth prytany (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:47.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 47.4</bibl>). The actual money was not collected by the Councilors, however, but by the ten <soCalled >Sellers</soCalled> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>οἱ πωληταί</foreign>), who were randomly chosen by lot (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κληροῦται</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:47.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 47.2</bibl>). These received the money and recorded the payment on tablets (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>καταβολαί</foreign>), which were brought to the Council by the Secretary (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>γραμματεύς</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:47.5' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 47.5</bibl>). In the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>, the Secretary handed the tablets over to the ten Receivers (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἀποδέκται</foreign>), who were also chosen by lot (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κεκληρωμένοι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.1</bibl>). These Receivers reviewed the receipts for payments in the presence of the Council, and recorded the names of everyone who had paid on their leases, and the amount they paid; then they gave the receipts back to the Secretary (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.1' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.1</bibl>). The Receivers then decide how to distribute (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>μερίζουσι</foreign>) the collected funds to the various officials, including (presumably) the Council itself. They write out this budget (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>μερισμός</foreign>, literally <soCalled >distribution</soCalled>) on another tablet; once they have read out the budget publically, the Council could debate its merits (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.2</bibl>). According to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name>, the specific concern in this debate was that some official or private citizen might have tried to influence the budget for his own advantage (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.2' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.2</bibl>), but it seems reasonable that other issues would be topics of debate as well, such as how much money each arm of the government should receive.</p>

<p >After the funds were apportioned, the Council appointed two groups of auditors to ensure that no one misused funds. One group was the ten Auditors (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>λογισταί</foreign>), whom the Council chose by lot (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κληροῦσι</foreign>) from their own members (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.4</bibl>). The other group was the ten Examiners (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>εὔθυνοι</foreign>), whom the Council chose by lot (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>κληροῦσι</foreign>) from the population as a whole (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.4</bibl>). The Auditors checked the records of each official at the end of each prytany (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.4</bibl>). The Examiners sat in public, by the Statues of the <name  type='person'>Eponymous Heroes</name>, and any citizen could come to them and lodge a complaint about how any official had handled public funds (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.4' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.4</bibl>). If an Examiner received a complaint, the matter did not go to the Council, but to the Thesmothetae, the <term  sortKey='Archons'>Archons</term>, who would hand the matter over to a jury (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:48.5' type='cts-urn'>Aristot. <title >Ath. Pol.</title> 48.5</bibl>).</p>

<p >So while the Council was at the center of the business of receiving and disbursing public money, the process was carefully designed to prevent corruption. The Councilors did not actually receive the money, nor did they actually keep the accounts, nor did they actually draw up the budget. They witnessed that process, approved the budget, and selected auditors. Even in the selection of auditors, the Council’s power was limited. Selection was by random lot, and in addition to the auditors chosen from among the members of the Council, there was an additional body of Examiners who were not Councilors. If this latter group found evidence of corruption, they did not report to the Council but to the <term  sortKey='Archons'>Archons</term> and the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>jury-courts</term>.</p>

<p >Even though there were 500 Councilors each year, the Athenians treated this institution carefully. It was not as democratic as the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> or the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>Lawcourts</term>, and while it was a necessary part of the government of the city, the Athenians were careful to keep its business open to scruty and its power in check.</p>
</div>

<div  n='ForeignPolicy' type='Section' xml:id='ForeignPolicy'>
<head >Foreign Policy</head>

<p >The most momentous decisions of Athenian foreign policy, matters of war and peace, were ultimately in the hands of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. Nevertheless, the Council, the institution of government that was <soCalled >open</soCalled> day and night, all year ’round, played an important role in how Athens interacted with the rest of the world. The Council often represented the People of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> in an official capacity, receiving ambassadors from foreign states, selecting Athenians to represent the city abroad, and taking advantage of its ability to discuss matters in confidence, apart from non-Athenian ears.</p>

<p >As we have already seen, the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> could not even debate a matter unless the Council had put it on the agenda by passing a probouleuma, or Preliminary Decree; this fact alone gave the Council a certain authority over matters of foreign policy. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> notes this at <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002:60' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 2.60-61</bibl>, when he accuses <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> of manipulating the Council in such a way that the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> was forced to discuss a matter of foreign policy <emph >before</emph> some Athenian ambassadors had returned from a mission.</p>

<p >The division of authority could go both ways, however. While the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> could not act without a Preliminary Decree from the Council, the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> could also empower the Council to take over business for which the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> itself was not well suited. An inscription bearing a decree of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> on the matter of the Athenian navy demonstates this; the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> set the outfitting of the fleet in motion, but it was up to the Council to see the business through. The Athenian navy, of course, was the most active and palpable instrument of Athenian foreign policy:</p>

<p ><quote >If anything is lacking from the present decree regarding the fleet,</quote> the Decree of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> says, <quote >the Council is authorized to make new resolutions, as long as it does not undo any of the decrees of the People</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἐὰν δέ τοῦ προσδέει τόδε τὸ ψήφισμα τῶν περὶ τὸν ἀπόστολον, τὴν βουλὴν κυρίαν εἶναι ψηφίζεσθαι μὴ λύουσαν μηθὲν τῶν ἐψηφισμένων τῶι δήμωι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 1629.264-269'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 1629.264-269</bibl>).</p>

<p >We can see the Council acting as the institution that represents <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> officially in a decree, preserved on an inscription, having to do with a treaty between the Athenian people and <name  type='person'>Dionysius</name>, the tyrant of <placeName  key='Syracuse'>Syracuse</placeName> in <placeName  key='Sicily'>Sicily</placeName>. Here, it seems that the Council, along with the Generals, Cavarly Commanders, and Commanders of Archers were to swear oaths committing <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> to a treaty of mutual military suppoer (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἡ συμμαχία</foreign>): <quote >It is decreed that the ambassadors who have come from Dionysius will carry the oath concerning the treaty of mutual military assistance, and it will be sworn by the Council, the Generals, the Cavalry Commanders, and the Commanders of Archers</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>λαβεῖν δὲ τὸν ὅρκον τὸμ περὶ τῆς συμμαχίας τοὺς πρέσβεις τοὺς παρὰ Διονυσίου ἥκοντας, ὀμόσαι δὲ τήν τε βουλὴν καὶ τὸς στρατηγοὺς καὶ τοὺς ἱππάρχους καὶ τοὺς ταξιάρχος</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 105.32-34 = Tod 136'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 105.32-34 = Tod 136</bibl>).</p>

<p >We have already seen that the <soCalled >Prytaneis</soCalled> where the fifty Councilors who served, on a day-in and day-out basis, for one-tenth of the Athenian year. It was to these men that messengers from abroad and envoys from foreign states came first, bearing news to the Athenians. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> describes a dramatic moment when messengers from the north of <placeName  key='Greece'>Greece</placeName> came to Athens bearing news that <name  type='person'>Philip</name> of <placeName  key='Macedon'>Macedon</placeName> had captured <placeName  key='Elatea'>Elatea</placeName>; the messengers came directly to the Prytaneis of the Council: <quote >Evening had already fallen when a messenger arrived bringing to the Prytaneis the news that <placeName  key='Elatea'>Elatea</placeName> had been taken. They were sitting at supper, but they instantly rose from table, cleared the booths in the marketplace of their occupants, and unfolded the hurdles, while others summoned the commanders and ordered the attendance of the trumpeter. The commotion spread through the whole city. At daybreak on the morrow the presidents summoned the Council to the <name  n='Bouleuterion, Athens' type='site'>Council House</name>, and the citizens flocked to the place of assembly. Before the Council could introduce the business and prepare the agenda, the whole body of citizens had taken their places on the hill.</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg018:169' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 18.169</bibl>). This passage shows clearly <emph >why</emph> it was appropriate for the Council to receive foreign visitors: any action in response to news from abroad, even if that action were the responsibility of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, would require the Council to, first, call an assembly, and second, put the matter at hand on the agenda of the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> by means of a Prelimary Decree.</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> says that it was usual for the Council to allow foreign ambassadors to address the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002:58' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 2.58</bibl>). The Council could also award visitors certain benefits, such as a meal at public expense (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg019:235' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 19.235</bibl>), or special seats in the <name  n='Theater of Dionysus, Athens' type='site'>Theater</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002:55' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 2.55</bibl>). But the Council could also treat ambassadors more curtly. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Xenophon</name> describes how, after the battle of <placeName  key='Leuctra'>Leuctra</placeName>, the Thebans sent messengers to ask Athens for an alliance against the Spartans: <quote >As for the Thebans, immediately after the battle they sent to <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> a garlanded messenger, and while telling of the greatness of their victory, they at the same time urged the Athenians to come to their aid, saying that now it was possible to take vengeance upon the Lacedaemonians for all the harm they had done to them. Now the Council of the Athenians chanced to be holding its meeting on the <name  n='Acropolis, Athens' type='site'>Acropolis</name>. And when they heard what had taken place, it was made clear to everyone that they were greatly distressed; for they did not invite the herald to partake of hospitality and about the matter of aid they gave him no answer. So the herald departed from <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> without having received a reply.</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0032.tlg001:6.4.20' type='cts-urn'>Xen. <title >Hell.</title> 6.4.20</bibl>).</p>

<p >Athenian ambassadors, too, when returning from a mission abroad, came to report first to the Council, before going to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> describes one such scene, when <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, serving as Councilor, moved that the Council award the ambassadors (including <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> himself) a crown and invite them to a meal at public expense: <quote >On our return, then, after we had rendered to the Council a brief report of our mission and had delivered the letter from <name  type='person'>Philip</name>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> praised us to his colleagues in the Council, and he swore by <name  type='god'>Hestia</name>, goddess of the Council, that he congratulated the city on having sent such men on the embassy, men who in honesty and eloquence were worthy of the state. In referring to me he said something like this: that I had not disappointed the hopes of those who elected me to the embassy. And to cap it all he moved that each of us be crowned with a garland of wild olive because of our loyalty to the People, and that we be invited to dine on the morrow in the <name  n='Prytaneum, Athens' type='site'>Prytaneum</name>.</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002:45' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 2.45-46</bibl>)</p>

<p >While the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> was responsible for selecting Athenians to serve as ambassadors to other states, it could delegate that authority to the Council. One decree, passed by both the Council and the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>People</term> (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 117'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 117</bibl>; it begins <quote >It seemed best to the Council and the People…,</quote> <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἔδοξεν τῆι βουλῆι καὶ τῶι δήμωι</foreign>) contains the following provision: <quote >[it is decreed] for the Council to select, at once, ten men as ambassadors, five from the Council and five from among the private citizens, who will receive the oaths from the people of <placeName  key='Eretria'>Eretria</placeName></quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ἑλέσθαι δὲ πρέσβες αὐτίκα μάλα τὴν βουλὴν δέκα ἄνδρας, πέντε μὲν ἐκ τῆς βουλῆς, πέντε δὲ ἐξ ἰδιωτῶν, οἵτινες ἀπολήψονται τοὺς ὅρκους παρὰ Ἐρετριέων</foreign>) (<bibl  n='IG 2.2 117.19-21'><title >IG</title> II<edition >2</edition> 117.19-21</bibl>).</p>

<p >Foreign policy often requires planning and acting in secret, and for this reason the Council was better suited than the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> for discussing sensitive issues. Unlike the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, whose proceedings took place out of doors, for all to hear, the Council could meet privately. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> says, <quote >The Council of the Five Hundred, thanks to this barrier <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CWB'>the wooden fence that prevented anyone from trespassing on the procedings</note>, frail as it is, is master of its own secrets, and no private citizen can enter it</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὸ τὴν βουλὴν τοὺς πεντακοσίους ἀπὸ τῆς [ἀσθενοῦς] τοιαυτησὶ κιγκλίδος τῶν ἀπορρήτων κυρίαν εἶναι, καὶ μὴ τοὺς ἰδιώτας ἐπεισιέναι</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg025:23' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 25.23</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> at one point accuses <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> of taking advantage of the Council’s ability to exclude private citizens from its meetings: <quote >Now when we had reported this decree to our Council, and then to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, and when the people had approved our acts, and the whole city was ready to choose the righteous course, and when <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> had spoken in opposition—he was earning his retaining-fee from <placeName  key='Amphissa'>Amphissa</placeName>—and when I had clearly convicted him in your presence, thereupon the fellow, unable to frustrate the city by open means, goes into the senate chamber, expels all listeners, and from the secret session brings out a bill to the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, taking advantage of the inexperience of the man who made the motion</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003:125' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 3.125-127</bibl>).</p>

<p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>’ accusations aside, there were clearly times when the Council needed to act secretly, such as when the Athenians were laying plans to oppose <name  type='person'>Alexander</name> the Great: <quote >Ultimately they chose as supreme commander the Athenian <name  type='person'>Leosthenes</name>, who was a man of unusually brilliant mind, and thoroughly opposed to the cause of <name  type='person'>Alexander</name>. He conferred secretly with the Council at <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> and was granted fifty talents to pay the troops and a stock of weapons sufficient to meet pressing needs</quote> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001:17.111.3' type='cts-urn'>Diod. 17.111.3</bibl>).</p>

<p >Between the Council and the <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, the Athenians had a system whereby the whole body of citizens had a say in how <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> interacted with the rest of the world, while still providing for around-the-clock responses to crises, formal and orderly reception of foreign dignitaries, and (most important) the ability to debate and decide matters secretly. Ironically, <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>’ attempt to oppose Macedonian power, which is the subject of the quotation from <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Diodorus</name> above, let to the end of the city’s independance as a free democracy. Having happened upon the end of classical Athenian democracy, in this discussion of the Council, it is worthwhile to back up and look at how the institution developed from the earliest days until its most fully developed form in the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>4th century BCE</date>. A discussion of that history and the sources for our knowledge of it appear in a separate Demos article (see <quote ><term  sortKey='council_history'>Council: its history</term></quote>).</p>
