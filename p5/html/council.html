<div class="Summary" id="Summary"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Summary</span></h2>

<p>The Council of 500 (<span class="foreign">ἡ βουλὴ οἱ πεντακόσιοι</span>) represented the full-time government of Athens. It consisted of 500 citizens, 50 from each of the ten tribes, who served for one year. The Council could issue decrees on its own regarding certain matters, but its main function was to prepare the agenda for meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The Council would meet to discuss and vote on ‘Preliminary decrees’ (<span class="foreign">προβουλεύματα</span>), and any of these that passed the Council’s vote went on for discussion and voting in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="General"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">General Principles</span></h2>


<p>The Athenian democracy rested on three institutions: the courts (the <span class="term">People’s Court</span> and the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>), the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and the Council (<span class="foreign">βουλή</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.100</span>). At Athens, the Council was formally called the Council of the 500 (<span class="foreign">ἡ βουλή οἱ πεντακόσιοι</span>), to distinguish it from the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> (see, for example, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.179</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">SEG</span> 19 133</span>).</p>

<p>Each member of the Council (<span class="foreign">βουλή</span>) was a Councilor (<span class="foreign">βουλεύτης</span>, in the plural, <span class="foreign">βουλεῦται</span>) (see for example <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.104</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andocides 2.14</span>).</p>

<p>Aristotle lists service the council among those offices chosen by lot (<span class="foreign">αἱ κληρωταὶ ἀρχαί</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 62.1</span>). He elsewhere says that in a democratic <span class="term">polis</span> (<span class="foreign">πόλις</span>), the Council was the most important board of magistrates (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1322b</span>).</p>

<p>Through most of the <span class="date">5th and 4th centures BCE</span>, citizens were paid for their participation in the Council (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 62.2</span>), and each citizen could serve on the Council twice in his lifetime (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 62.3</span>).</p>

<p>Although participation in the Council was paid, and considered an ‘office’ (<span class="foreign">ἀρχή</span>), it also seems to have been considered an unexceptional part of a citizen’s life, rather than a part of a political career. In Plato’s <span class="titlem">Apology of Socrates</span> (an account, perhaps largely fictional, of the speech Socrates gave when on trial for impiety), Socrates says that he served on the council (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Apol.</span> 32a-b</span>), but also says that he never participated in politics (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Apol.</span> 31c-d</span>). So, in Plato’s account, it seems that service on the Council did not indicate political ambition, or even any special interest in politics.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Selection"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Eligibility and Selection</span></h2>


<p>The 500 members of the Council, each one called a <span class="foreign">βουλευτής</span>, or ‘Councilor,’ were chosen by lot; each of the ten tribes (<span class="foreign">φυλαί</span>) of Athens contributed 50 Councilors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.2</span>).</p>

<div class="p">A citizen had to be 30 years old to serve on the Council (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 1.2.35</span>), an age-limit that may have dated back to the time of Draco (the semi-mythological first lawgiver of Athens) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 4.3</span>). Some Athenians certainly seem to have thought that this age was the traditional limit for service as a Councilor—or thought that making such a claim would sound reasonable—since during the oligarchic coup of <span class="date">411 BCE</span>, when the democracy was temporarily overthrown, the first act of the oligarchic revolutionaries was to <span class="quote_inline">set up a Council of 400, according to the ways of the ancestors</span> (<span class="foreign">βουλεύειν μὲν τετρακοσίους κατὰ τὰ πάτρια</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 31.1</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>), the oligarchic Council was limited to men over thirty years old (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 30.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 31.1</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Citizens probably had to volunteer to serve on the Council, rather than be appointed or drafted into service; in a speech by Lysias, the speaker says, <span class="quote_inline">What I say is that only those have the right to sit in Council on our concerns who, besides holding the <span class="term">citizenship</span>, have their hearts set upon it</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐγὼ γὰρ οὐκ ἄλλους τινάς φημι δίκαιον εἶναι βουλεύειν περὶ ἡμῶν, ἢ τοὺς πρὸς τῷ εἶναι πολίτας καὶ ἐπιθυμοῦντας τούτου</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 31.5</span>; see also<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"> Lys. 31.32-33</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 15.149</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Selection by lot (<span class="foreign">κλήρωσις</span>) involved bronze tablets (<span class="foreign">χαλκοῦς</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 39.10</span>). It is not clear whether all 500 Councilors were chosen at once, in a central location, or whether they were chosen in the various demes. Demosthenes refers to <span class="quote_inline">the city selecting <span class="note" id="Note1"> [Councilors]</span> by lot</span> (<span class="foreign">ἡ πόλις κληροῖ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 39.10</span>), which would suggest a centrally managed process. But Aristotle says this:</div>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>The officials elected by lot were formerly those elected from the whole tribe together with the <span class="term">Nine Archons</span> and those now elected in the Temple of Theseus who used to be divided among the demes; but since the demes began to sell their offices, the latter also are elected by lot from the whole tribe, excepting members of the Council and Guards; these they entrust to the demes</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 62.1</span>).</div>

<p>This might mean that selection for the Council took place in the individual demes. It is more likely to mean that selection took place centrally, in the Theseum, the Temple of Theseus, and that the 500 places on the Council were divided up not only into 50 for each of the ten tribes, but further within each tribe, so that each deme had a certain number of Councilors on the Council.</p>

<p>The ‘Thesmothetae’ conducted the selection in the Theseum (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.13</span>); ‘thesmothete’ (<span class="foreign">θεσμοθέτης</span>) was the name given to six of the <span class="term">Nine Archons</span>, with the other three being the ‘<span class="term">Archon</span>’ (<span class="foreign">ἄρχων</span>), the ‘<span class="term">King Archon</span>’ (<span class="foreign">βασιλεύς</span>), and the ‘<span class="term">Warlord</span>’ (<span class="foreign">πολέμαρχος</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.1</span>).</p>

<p>Unlike other political offices in the Athenian democracy, a citizen was not limited to one term of service on the Council, but could serve twice (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 62.3</span>).</p>

<div class="p">We also hear of substitute Councilors, chosen in addition to the 500 Councilors. Aeschines says, speaking against Demosthenes: <span class="quote_inline">Now Demosthenes came in as Councilor, not drawn by the lot either as a member of the senate or as a substitute, but through intrigue and bribery</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐνταῦθ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??εἰσέρχεται βουλευτὴς Δημοσθένης, οὔτε λαχὼν οὔτ᾽ ἐπιλαχών, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκ παρασκευῆς πριάμενος</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.62</span>). A fragment from a comic play by the comic poet Plato (not Plato the philosopher), suggests that each Councilor chosen by lot (<span class="foreign">λαχών</span>) had a corresponding substitute (<span class="foreign">ἐπιλαχών</span>) assigned to replace him if he proved ineligable for the office:</div>

<div class="p">
<br />Speaker A: <span class="quote_inline">…you are lucky, Master.</span>
<br />Speaker B: <span class="quote_inline">How?</span>
<br />Speaker A: <span class="quote_inline">You were almost chosen to be a Councilor, but although you were not chosen, nevertheless you were chosen, if you get my meaning.</span>
<br />Speaker B: <span class="quote_inline">How can I get your meaning?</span>
<br />Speaker A: <span class="quote_inline">I mean that you were chosen as a substitute for an evil man, a foreigner, who is not even yet a free man.</span>
<br />Speaker B: <span class="quote_inline">Get out of here! Indeed, I will explain it to you, the audience: I was chosen as a substitute Councilor for Hyperbolus.</span>
</div>

<p>
<br />A: <span class="foreign">...εὐτυχεῖς, ὦ δέσποτα.</span>
<br />B: <span class="foreign">τί δ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἔστι;</span> A: <span class="foreign">βουλεύειν ὀλίγου ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς?Λαχες πάνυ.</span>
<br /><span class="foreign">ἀτὰρ οὐ λαχὼν ὅμως ἔλαχες, ἢν νοῦν ἔχῃς.</span>
<br />B: <span class="foreign">πῶς ἢν ἔχω νοῦν;</span> A: <span class="foreign">ὅτι πονηρῷ καὶ ξένῳ</span>
<br /><span class="foreign">ἐπέλαχες ἀνδρί, οὐδέπω γὰρ ἐλευθέρῳ.</span>
<br />B: <span class="foreign">ἄπερρ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς?? ἐγὼ δ᾽ ὑμῖν τὸ πρᾶγμα δὴ φράσω·</span>
<br /><span class="foreign">Ὑπερβόλῳ βουλῆς γάρ, ἄνδρες, ἐπέλαχον.</span>
</p>

<p>(<span class="bibl">Plato Comicus, <span class="titlem">Hyperbolos,</span> fragments 166-167</span>)</p>


<div class="p">In this fragmentary excerpt from a comic play, an Athenian citizen seems to be having a conversation with his slave (who calls him <span class="quote_inline">master</span>). According to the slave, the citizen has not been chosen by lot to serve on the Council, but will nevertheless get to serve. The citizen is slow to catch on, but eventually realizes the slave’s meaning: because the citizens has been <span class="quote_inline">chosen as a substitute Councilor</span> (<span class="foreign">βουλῆς ἐπέλαχον</span>) for Hyperbolus, he will almost certainly get to serve on the Council after all, because Hyperbolus is such an evil man that he will inevitably get expelled. This passage is obviously a joke at the expense of Hyperbolus, but it probably reflects a reality of the Council: not only were substitute Councilors (<span class="foreign">ἐπιλαχόντες</span>) chosen, but each one was chosen as a substitute for a specific Councilor. If a Councilor chosen by lot should be expelled from the body, then the <span class="foreign">ἐπιλαχών</span> chosen for him would take his seat.</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Scrutiny"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Scrutiny of Councilors</span></h2>


<p>Before taking their seats on the Council, newly selected Councilors had to undergo ‘scrutiny’ (<span class="foreign">δοκιμασία</span>), an audit of their fitness to serve (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.3</span>).</p>

<p>Lysias makes the claim that the ‘law of scrutiny’ was primarily intended to deny political office to men who had participated in one of the short-lived oligarchic coups of the <span class="date">5th century BCE</span>, or the Tyranny of the Thirty (these events are discussed below) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.9-10</span>). But scrutiny was a broadly important institution in the Athenian democracy, and Lysias’ statement is probably too narrow to reflect strictly historical reality.</p>

<p>The <span class="term">Nine Archons</span> underwent scrutiny before taking office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.2</span>), as did the ten <span class="term">generals</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 15.1-2</span>), and priests, advocates, heralds, and ambassadors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.19-20</span>). In fact, according to Aeschines, any citizen could call upon any other citizen to undergo scrutiny at any time, to determine whether he deserved the privilege of speaking before the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.32</span>). Furthermore, every young Athenian man underwent a scrutiny before the members of his deme before he was enrolled in the list of citizens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 44.41</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.21</span>).</p>

<p>The scrutiny of newly selected Councilors was managed by the Thesmothetae, the lower six of the nine <span class="term">archons</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 59.4</span>), but it was the outgoing Council that decided whether each of the 500 new Councilors was eligible to take office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.3</span>). During this process, other citizens were invited to give testimony, under oath, before the Council (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 31.1-2</span>). Given the large number of Councilors who had to be scrutinized each year, it would be surprising if each candidate were given lengthy consideration, and in fact, a passage from Lysias admits that the scrutiny of a potential Councilor—who was one of 500 men serving for only one year—was ususally less strict than scrutiny of a candidate for the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, who would hold that office for life (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.11-12</span>).</p>

<p>This scrutiny took into account almost every aspect of a citizen’s life, public and private, and we can learn much about the values of the Athenian democracy from the questions asked during a scrutiny, and grounds for which a candidate could fail his scrutiny.</p>

<div class="p">According to Aristotle, a candidate for the Council was asked, <blockquote class="quote"><p>Who is your father and to what deme does he belong, and who is your father’s father, and who is your mother, and who is her father and what is his deme? Then whether he has a Family Apollo and Homestead Zeus, and where these shrines are; then whether he has family tombs and where they are; then whether he treats his parents well, and whether he pays his taxes, and whether he has done his military service</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.3-4</span>). According to Xenophon, they were also asked if they honored their family graves (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 2.2.13</span>).</div>

<p>After the candidate was asked the standard questions, the floor was open for any interested citizen to bring accusations against the candidate, and if anyone did so, the candidate could speak in his own defense (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.4</span>).</p>

<div class="p">In Aeschines’ speech against Timarchus, in which the orator accuses Timarchus of having been a prostitute, he gives a long list of crimes and misdeeds that, according to the Law of Scrutiny of Public Speakers (<span class="foreign">δοκιμασία ῥητόρων</span>), would make a man ineligible to address the <span class="term">Assembly</span>; we can probably assume that the same offenses that would cause a citizen to lose that right would also cause him to lose the right to serve on the Council. Those ineligable to address the <span class="term">Assembly</span> include, according to the orator, anyone <span class="quote_inline">living a shameful life</span> (<span class="foreign">αἰσχρῶς βεβιωκότας</span>), anyone who beats his father or mother or who has failed to support and provide a home for them, anyone failing to perform military service or who has thrown away his shield in battle, anyone who has prostituted himself, and anyone who has squandered his inheritance (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.28-30</span>).</div>

<div class="p">By the <span class="date">early 4th century</span>, the Athenian democracy, barely one hundred years old, had experienced a period in which an oligarchy had taken power away from the People, and another period under the tyranny of the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span> (these events are discussed in the <span class="term">article on the history of the Council</span>). It is not surprising, then, that in the time of Lysias—who lived from around <span class="date">445 BCE until around 380 BCE</span>—candidates for the Council were scrutinized for any sign that they had supported these anti-democratic governments (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Perseus Encyclopedia, s.v. ‘Lysias’</span>). Lysias even claims that this was the main purpose of scrutiny: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Reflect also on the fact that the author of the law concerning scrutinies had chiefly in view the magistrates of the oligarchy; for he thought it monstrous that the men responsible for the overthrow of the democracy should regain office under that very constitution, and get control over the laws and over the city of which they had formerly taken charge only to maim her with such shameful and terrible injuries</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.9</span>). The orator continues to note, specifically, that if candidate were found to have served in the cavalry during the Tyranny of the <span class="term">Thirty</span>, <span class="quote_inline">you would reject him even without an accuser</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.10</span>). In a speech that Lysias wrote against an Athenian named Philon, the speaker urges the Council to reject the man, not because he actively supported the <span class="term">Tyranny</span>, but merely because he failed to oppose it actively (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 31.12-14</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Elsewhere in that same speech, we find the assertion that <span class="quote_inline">only those have the right to sit in Council on our concerns who, besides holding the <span class="term">citizenship</span>, have their hearts set upon it</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 31.5</span>). It is possible that a candidate could fail his scrutiny merely for showing too little enthusiasm for the office, but this passage is probably nothing more than a rhetorical statement intended to show that the speaker holds Athens’ democratic institutions in the highest regard.</div>

<div class="p">After the candidate answered the questions, and any accusers had come forward, the Council voted by show of hands (<span class="foreign">ἐπιχειροτονία</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.4</span>). According to Aristotle, originally the vote of the Council was the last word in a scrutiny, but in his time (<span class="date">the middle of the 4th century BCE</span>) <span class="quote_inline">there is an appeal to the <span class="term">Jury-court</span>, and with this rests the final decision as to qualification</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.2</span>).</div>

<p>A passage from a speech by Lysias confirms that a candidate who was rejected by the Council could appeal to a jury, while noting that this appeal could take time, and might result in the year beginning without a full body of magistrates in office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.6</span>).</p>

<div class="p">In addition to the evidence suggesting that Councilors would be rejected for various offenses, including having served in the cavalry during the rule of the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>, there is evidence that these rules were not hard and fast. In the speech Lysias wrote for Mantitheus, who was defending himself in a scrutiny, he suggests that the Council, or a jury hearing an appeal, could take into account mitigating circumstances: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Besides, gentlemen if I had served <span class="note" id="Note2"> [in the cavalry under the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>]</span>, I should not deny it as though I had done something monstrous: I should merely claim, after showing that no citizen had suffered injury by my act, to pass the scrutiny. And I see that you also take this view, and that many of those who served then in the cavalry are on the Council, while many others have been elected generals and brigadiers</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 16.8</span>). The speaker is suggesting that men who were technically ineligable for service on the Council could be, and were, approved if they could show that they had not harmed anyone.</div>

<div class="p">In the speech against Philon, Lysias suggests that crimes in a candidate’s past could be balanced by subsequent service to the Athenian democracy. Here he asks his audience to reject Philon’s candidacy, because of the man’s past crimes, until he has done good deeds sufficient to redeem himself: <blockquote class="quote"><p>What inducement, then, could you have for approving this man? Because he has committed no offence ? But he is guilty of the gravest crimes against his country. Or do you think he will reform? Then, I say, let him reform first in his bearing towards the city, and claim a seat on the Council later, when he has done her a service as signal as the wrong that he did her before</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 31.24</span>).</div>

<div class="p"> After the scrutiny was completed, those who had passed were ceremonially sworn into service as Councilors for the year: <blockquote class="quote"><p>And when the matter has been checked in this way, they go to the stone on which are the victims cut up for sacrifice (the one on which Arbitrators also take oath before they issue their decisions, and persons summoned as witnesses swear that they have no evidence to give), and mounting on this stone they swear that they will govern justly and according to the laws, and will not take presents on account of their office, and that if they should take anything they will set up a golden statue. After taking oath they go from the stone to the Acropolis and take the same oath again there, and after that they enter on their office</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.

<div class="Section" id="Oath"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">The Bouleutic Oath</span></h2>


<p>Upon passing their scrutiny (<span class="foreign">δοκιμασία</span>), the new Councilors swore the so-called ‘Bouleutic Oath.’ According to Aristotle, this practice dated back to the eighth year after Cleisthenes established the democracy, or <span class="date">501/500 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.2</span>; source for date, <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Rhodes, <span class="titlem">Commentary on the Aristotelian <span class="titlem">Athenaion Politeia</span></span> [Oxford, 1993] 262</span>).</p>

<p>There is no single literary text or inscription that records the oath that the Councilors (<span class="foreign">βουλτεῦται</span>) swore, but we can reconstruct it from scattered comments and references in different texts and inscriptions. It is important to remember, however, that these sources are from different dates, some from the <span class="date">5th century</span> (Lysias), some from the early <span class="date">4th century</span> (Xenophon), and some from the later <span class="date">4th century BCE</span> (Demosthenes). It is unlikely that the oath remained the same in wording and content over the course of 200 years. Nevertheless, the evidence we have does give us a picture of how the Athenians both empowered, and limited the power of, the Council.</p>

<div class="p">The Councilors swore <span class="quote_inline">to advise according to the laws</span> (<span class="foreign">κατὰ τοὺς νόμους βουλεύσειν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 1.1.18</span>). According to two passages from Lysias, they swore <span class="quote_inline">to advise what was best for the city</span> (<span class="foreign">τὰ βέλτιστα βουλεύσειν τῇ πόλει</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 31.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.10</span>). Demosthenes mentions Councilors swearing to advise <span class="quote_inline">what was best for the People</span> (<span class="foreign">τὰ βέλτιστα βουλεύσειν τῷ δήμῳ Ἀθηναίων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.4</span>).</div>

<div class="p">According to Demosthenes, the Councilors included this clause in their oath: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Nor will I imprison any Athenian citizen who provides three people to guarantee his debt, guarantors who are in the same tax-bracket, except anyone found guilty of conspiring to betray the city or to subvert the democracy, or anyone who has contracted to collect taxes, or his guarantor, or his collector who is in default</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">οὐδὲ δήσω Ἀθηναίων οὐδένα, ὃς ἂν ἐγγυητὰς τρεῖς καθιστῇ τὸ αὐτὸ τέλος τελοῦντας, πλὴν ἐάν τις ἐπὶ προδοσίᾳ τῆς πόλεως ἢ ἐπὶ καταλύσει τοῦ δήμου συνιὼν ἁλῷ, ἢ τέλος πριάμενος ἢ ἐγγυησάμενος ἢ ἐκλέγων μὴ καταβάλῃ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.144</span>). This clause would prevent a creditor from having an Athenian citizen arrested for debt, assuming that the citizen could provide three other citizens who would co-sign his debt; the exceptions are traitors, and ‘tax-farmers,’ that is, men who had paid for the privilege of collecting taxes on behalf of the Athenian government. A few sentences later in the same speech, Demosthenes claims that Solon, the law-giver of the <span class="date">6th century BCE</span>, was responsible for this provision (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.148</span>).</div>

<div class="p">A passage from a speech attributed to Andocides claims that the <span class="quote_inline">oath of the People and the Council</span> (<span class="foreign">τῷ ὅρκῳ τοῦ δήμου καὶ τῆς βουλῆς</span>) included a promise <span class="quote_inline">not to exile, nor imprison, nor execute anyone without a trial</span> (<span class="foreign">μηδένα μήτε ἐξελᾶν μήτε δήσειν μήτε ἀποκτενεῖν ἄκριτον</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 4.3</span>).</div>

<div class="p">According to Lysias, Councilors swore an oath, <span class="quote_inline">to let it be known if he knows of anyone who has been selected by lot but is not fit to serve on the Council</span> (<span class="foreign">ἀποφανεῖν εἴ τίς τινα οἶδε τῶν λαχόντων ἀνεπιτήδειον ὄντα βουλεύειν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 31.2</span>), and <span class="quote_inline">to crown a man as worthy of public office only after scrutinizing him</span> (<span class="foreign">δοκιμάσαντες τὸν ἄξιον τῆς ἀρχῆς στεφανώσειν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.8</span>).</div>

<div class="p">A fragmentary quotation from the ancient historian Philochorus adds to our list of clauses in the Bouleutic Oath: <blockquote class="quote"><p>And the Council at that time began for the first time to sit according to letters; and even now they swear to sit in the letter to which they have been randomly assigned</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">καὶ ἡ βουλὴ κατὰ γράμμα τότε πρῶτον ἐκαθέζετο· καὶ ἔτι νῦν ὀμνῦσιν ἀπ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἐκείνου καθεδεῖσθαι ἐν τῶι γράμματι ὧι ἂν λάχωσιν</span>) (<span class="bibl">Philoch. 328 F 140</span>; quoted in a scholion, or marginal note, to <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Pl.</span> 972</span>). This <span class="quote_inline">sitting by letters</span> seems to mean that Councilors were assigned seats for their meetings, and they swore to sit only in their assigned seats. This might have been intended to prevent factions from forming within the Council, as might happen if all of the Councilors from one deme sat together when the whole body met.</div>

<div class="p">An inscription from <span class="date">448 BCE</span> records an addition to the Bouleutic Oath. The added clause commits the Council to ensuring that only Athenian money be used in the cities that pay tribute to Athens. The text of the inscription has had to be restored by modern scholars (as with virtually all inscriptions), but it has been reconstructed to read: <blockquote class="quote"><p>And the secretary of the Council is to add a clause to the Oath of the Council, to this effect: Should anyone mint coins of silver in the cities and not use Athenian coins, standard weights, or standard measures, but uses foreign coins, weights, and measures, we will punish him and fine him according to the earlier decree that Clearchus sponsored</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">προσγράψαι δὲ πρὸς τὸν ὅρκον τὸν τῆς βολῆς τὸν γραμματέα τὸν τῆς βολῆς ταδί· ἐάν τις κόπτῆι νόμισμα ἀργυρίο ἐν τῆσι πόλεσι καὶ μὴ χρῆται νομίσμασι τοῖς Ἀθηναίων ἢ σταθμοῖς ἢ μέτροις ἀλλὰ ξενικοῖς νομίσμασιν καὶ μέτροις καὶ στάθμοις, τιμωρήσομαι καὶ ζημιώσω κατὰ τὸ πρότερον ψήφισμα ὃ Κλέαρχος εἶπεν</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 1453</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">P.J. Rhodes, <span class="titlem">The Athenian Boule</span> [Oxford, 1972] 194</span>).</div>

<div class="p">A speech by Demosthenes quotes portions of a different oath, the one sworn by jurors in the <span class="term">People’s Court</span>. These jurors swore, among other things, that <span class="quote_inline">I am not less than thirty years old</span> (<span class="foreign">γέγονα οὐκ ἔλαττον ἢ τριάκοντα ἔτη</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.151</span>). Since Xenophon tells us that Councilors also had to be at least thirty years old (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 1.2.35</span>), it is possible that Councilors likewise swore that they met the age requirement. On the other hand, as P.J. Rhodes has pointed out, such an oath might not have been necessary once each candidate for the Council had undergone scrutiny (see <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">P.J. Rhodes, <span class="titlem">The Athenian Boule</span> [Oxford, 1972] 195</span>).</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="prytanes"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">‘Presidents’ and ‘Chairman’</span></h2>


<div class="p">Five hundred Councilors served on the <span class="foreign">βουλή</span> for the year, but practical concerns required that they be divided into smaller groups. Accordingly, the legislative year was divided into ten parts, each called a ‘prytany’ (<span class="foreign">πρυτανεία</span>); for each prytany, the fifty Councilors (<span class="foreign">βουλεῦται</span>) from one of the ten tribes (<span class="foreign">φυλαί</span>) served as ‘presidents,’ or prytanes (<span class="foreign">πρυτάνεις</span>, in the singular, <span class="foreign">πρύτανις</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.2-3</span>; the inscription <span class="bibl">Agora 15.38</span> contains a list of tribes and when they held the prytany). The first four prytanies were 36 days long, the last six were 35 days long, <span class="quote_inline">for the year is divided into lunar months</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.2</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The order in which the Councilors from each tribe served as presidents was random, determined by lot (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.2</span>). The random determination seems to have taken place at the end of each prytany (rather than all at once at the beginning of the year), so no one could predict which tribe would serve next. An inscription makes reference to <span class="quote_inline">the presidents, whichever ones might hold that position after the tribe of Oineis</span> (<span class="foreign">τοὺς πρυτάνεις οἳ ἂν τυγχάνωσι πρυτανεύοντες μετὰ τὴν Οἰνηΐδα φυλὴν</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 553.16-17</span>). When the decree was written, the Councilors from the tribe of Oineis were serving as prytanes, or presidents; the decree needed to refer to the next group of presidents, but that group was clearly not known. So, we can infer from this that the selection must have happened toward the end of a prytany. Obviously, during the ninth prytany of the year, it would be obvious that whichever tribe had not yet served would hold the presidency for the final prytany.</div>

<p>This elaborate randomization of the presidency was probably intended to limit possibilities for corruption. No one could plan to introduce business to the Council when a particular tribe held the presidency, and no Councilor could know in advance when he would serve as a president.</p>

<p>The presidents ate their meals together in the Tholos, the ‘Round House.’ They planned and organized meetings of the Council and posted an agenda for each meeting beforehand (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.3</span>; meetings of the Council are discussed below).</p>

<div class="p">Aristotle tells us that <blockquote class="quote"><p>There is a chairman of the presidents, one man, chosen by lot; this man chairs for a night and a day—no longer—and cannot become chairman a second time</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ἔστι δ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἐπιστάτης τῶν πρυτάνεων εἷς ὁ λαχών. οὗτος δ᾽ ἐπιστατεῖ νύκτα καὶ ἡμέραν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν οὔτε πλείω χρόνον οὔτε δὶς τὸν αὐτὸν γενέσθαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.1</span>). This chairman kept the keys to the treasuries and archives of Athens, as well as the state seal (<span class="foreign">τὴν δημοσίαν σφραγῖδα</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.1</span>).</div>

<p>In addition to a daily meeting of all the presidents, the chairman and one third of the presidents were required to be on hand in the Tholos constantly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.1</span>); presumably only the chairman was on duty for a full 24 hours, and the other presidents could divide the day into 8 hour shifts. These men, on-call in the Tholos, represented the whole government of Athens in a time of crisis, at least until the full Council or <span class="term">Assembly</span> could be convened. Heralds and envoys from other states came to the presidents in the Tholos first, as did messenger bearing official letters (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.6</span>).</p>

<p>Demosthenes describes a dramatic scene, that shows clearly the function of the presidents and the chairman. In <span class="date">339 BCE</span>, Philip of Macedon marched his army south and captured the city of Elatea, thus threatening Thebes and the Thebans’ southern neighbor, Athens (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Raphael Sealey, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes and his Time: a study in defeat</span> [Oxford, 1993] 195</span>). Demosthenes describes what happened when news of this threat came to Athens:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Evening had already fallen when a messenger arrived bringing to the presiding councillors (<span class="foreign">πρυτάνεις</span>) the news that Elatea had been taken. They were sitting at supper, but they instantly rose from table, cleared the booths in the marketplace of their occupants, and unfolded the hurdles, while others summoned the commanders and ordered the attendance of the trumpeter. The commotion spread through the whole city. At daybreak on the next day the presidents summoned the Council to the Council House, and the citizens flocked to the place of <span class="term">assembly</span>. Before the Council could introduce the business and prepare the agenda, the whole body of citizens had taken their places on the hill. The Council arrived; the presiding Councilors formally reported the intelligence they had received; and the courier was introduced</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.18.169-170</span>).</div>

<p>So, in a crisis, the safety of Athens lay first in the hands of the presidents and the chairman. It is worth noting that because there were 354 days in the legislative year (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.2</span>), more than two thirds of all Councilors would serve as chairman for a night and a day in a given year.</p>

<p>There are further implications, if we accept the estimate of two scholars that in <span class="date">400 BCE</span> there were approximately 22,000 adult male citizens—it is beyond the scope of this article to give evidence and justification for this, but the arguments are presented in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Victor Ehrenberg, <span class="titlem">The Greek State</span>, 2nd English Edition (Methuen, 1969) 31</span>, whose estimate is 20,000-25,000, and in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">A.W. Gomme, <span class="titlem">The Population of Athens in the Fifth and Fourth Centuries B.C.</span> (Blackwell, 1933) 26</span>, whose estimate is 22,000.</p>

<p>A citizen had to be 30 years old to serve as a Councilor (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 1.2.35</span>). For the sake of argument, we might assume that the average citizen would then have an active political life of 30 years, until he was 60. During that time, there would need to be approximately 10,000 chairmen, each controlling the state seal and the treasuries, and presiding over the presidents of the Council for a day and a night (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.1</span>). Since no one could serve as chairman twice (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.1</span>), this office would have to go to 10,000 different Athenians. It follows, then, that approximately one half of all Athenian citizens would, at some point during their lives, have the privilege and responsibility of holding this office, arguably the closest equivalent to a Chief Executive in the Athenian democracy.</p>
 </div>

<div class="Section" id="Rewards"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">Rewards for Service</span></h2>


<div class="p">Service on the Council was a privilege, but also a responsibility, a responsibility often difficult for an Athenian citizen to fulfill. The territory of Attica was large, and any Councilor who lived outside of the city of Athens would have faced a long walk before and after every meeting. A passage from Demosthenes confirms what common sense would suggest: that there were always Councilors who were not active participants in the business of the Council, and who did not even attend all of the meetings. In this passage, Demosthenes is asking, rhetorically, whether every member of the Council will suffer if the <span class="term">Assembly</span> fails to award the Councilors a crown in honor of their service. <span class="note" id="Note3"> [the business of awarding crown to the Council is described below.]</span> Demosthenes asks, <blockquote class="quote"><p>If the Council does not receive a crown, does the disgrace fall on the one who is silent, and proposes no decree, and perhaps does not even enter the Council House most of the time? Surely it does not.</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">τῷ γάρ ἐστιν ὄνειδος, εἰ σιωπῶντος αὐτοῦ καὶ μηδὲν γράφοντος, ἴσως δ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??οὐδὲ τὰ πόλλ᾽ εἰς τὸ βουλευτήριον εἰσιόντος, μὴ λάβοι ἡ βουλὴ τὸν στέφανον; οὐδενὶ δήπουθεν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 22.36</span>).</div>

<p>Demosthenes’ rhetorical question would not have been particularly meaningful or effective if his audience did not know that at least some Councilors skipped meetings. So what incentives induced Councilors to attend? We have already seen that the Presidents (<span class="foreign">πρυτάνεις</span>)—who had daily duty during their month of service—had their meals provided in the Tholos (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.3</span>). It would make sense that they simply lived in the city of Athens during that month. In Plato’s philophical dialogue, the <span class="titlem">Laws</span>, one of the characters is ‘the Athenian’, and this character says that in a properly organized state the Councilors in general can live in the countryside during the year, but the Presidents of the Council should remain in Athens while they serve their term (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Laws</span> 758b-d</span>). This work is not history, but philosophy, and the characters are discussing an ideal state, but it is quite possible that ‘the Athenian’ here is describing actual practice in Athens.</p>

<p>Councilors were paid to attend meetings of the Council. In the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>, each Councilor received 5 obols at each meeting of the Council (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 62.2</span>), and the Presidents received an extra obol for their meals (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 62.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.3</span>; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.69.4</span> for evidence that the Councilors received some pay in the <span class="date">5th century</span> as well).</p>

<p>Councilors were exempt from military service during their year in office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lyc. 1.37</span>). They also got to wear a crown (<span class="foreign">στέφανος</span>) to mark their status (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lyc. 1.122</span>). A certain section of seat in the Theater of Dionysus was called the Council Section (<span class="foreign">βουλευτικός</span>), which suggests that Councilors enjoyed preferred seating (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Birds</span> 794</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Suda beta,430</span>).</p>

<p>At the end of the year, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could award the Council an honorary crown (<span class="foreign">στέφανος</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.112</span>); this award is also referred to as an ‘honorarium’ (<span class="foreign">δωρεά</span>; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 46.1</span>).</p> 

<div class="p">It seems that the Council had to request that award, specifically from the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and put the request on the agenda for a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, as the end of the year approached. Aristotle tells us that, if the Council had not fulfilled its reponsibilities toward the Athenian navy, it was not eligible to receive its honorarium (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 46.1</span>). Demosthenes also mentions the <span class="quote_inline">the law that specifically denies to the Council the right to request an honorarium if they have not built the warships</span> (<span class="foreign">τοῦ νόμου τοῦ διαρρήδην οὐκ ἐῶντος ἐξεῖναι μὴ ποιησαμένῃ τῇ βουλῇ τὰς τριήρεις αἰτῆσαι τὴν δωρειάν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 22.8</span>). This passage confirms what Aristotle says—that the honorarium was not automatic, but depended on the Council’s fulfilling its responsibilities. It also informs us that, even if the Council did fulfill its responsibilties, it did not have the right to an honorium, but the right to request one (<span class="foreign">αἰτῆσαι τὴν δωρειάν</span>).</div>

<p>Aeschines mentions one occasion on which the <span class="term">Assembly</span> withheld the honorarium from the Council, due to the Council’s failure to punish two men suspected of embezzling funds from the treasury of Athene (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.110-113</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Individual Councilors could be honored for exceptional service as well. An inscription from the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span> lists the names of Athenians <span class="quote_inline">whom the People judged to have served best as Councilors</span> (<span class="foreign">τούσδε ἐστεφάνωσεν ὁ δῆμος κρίνας ἄριστα βεβουλευκέναι</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 2797 A</span>).</div>

<p>So, while we have seen evidence that not all Councilors took an active role, or even attended all the meetings, the Athenian democracy paid every Councilor for his daily service, afforded all Councilors certain privileges, could award the Council as a whole for having done good service, and could single out individual citizens whose service was exceptional.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="MeetingPlaces"><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">Times and Places of Meetings</span></h2>


<div class="p">The Chairman (<span class="foreign">ἐπιστάτης</span>) and one third of the Presidents (<span class="foreign">πρυτάνεις</span>) of the Council were always on duty (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.1</span>). These Presidents convened meetings of the council, <span class="quote_inline">the Council, indeed, meeting every day, unless the day is exempt</span> (<span class="foreign">τὴν μὲν οὖν βουλὴν ὅσαι ἡμέραι, πλὴν ἐάν τις ἀφέσιμος ᾖ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.3</span>).</div>

<p>We cannot examine all of the evidence regarding the Athenian calendar, to develop a full picture of what days during the year were ‘exempt’ (<span class="foreign">ἀφέσιμος</span>) from meetings of the Council—Jon D. Mikalson, <span class="titlem">The Sacred and Civil Calendar of the Athenian Year</span> (Princeton, 1975) is the most complete presentation of that evidence. But we can see a few examples of occasions on which the Council did not meet.</p>

<div class="p">Demosthenes, for example, accuses a certain Timocrates of having taken unjust advantage of an ‘exempt’ day: <blockquote class="quote"><p>The assembly at which your vote was taken fell on the eleventh of Hecatombaeon, and he introduced his law on the twelfth, the very next day, although it was a feast of Cronus and the Council therefore stood adjourned.</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ἀλλὰ τῆς ἐκκλησίας, ἐν ᾗ τοὺς νόμους ἐπεχειροτονήσατε, οὔσης ἑνδεκάτῃ τοῦ ἑκατομβαιῶνος μηνός, δωδεκάτῃ τὸν νόμον εἰσήνεγκεν, εὐθὺς τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ, καὶ ταῦτ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ὄντων Κρονίων καὶ διὰ ταῦτ᾽ ἀφειμένης τῆς βουλῆς</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.26</span>).</div>

<p>According to Demosthenes, Timocrates conspired with a certain Epicrates to have a decree passed in the Council; the text of the decree (<span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span>) is reported in Demosthenes’ speech as follows:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>During the first presidency, namely, that of the Tribe Pandionis, and on the eleventh day of that presidency, it was moved by Epicrates that, in order that the sacrifices may be offered, that provision may be adequate, and that any lack of funds for the Panathenian Festival may be made good, the Presidents of the Tribe Pandionis do tomorrow set up a <span class="term">Legislative Committee</span>, and that such <span class="term">Legislative Committee</span> do consist of one thousand and one citizens who have taken the oath, and that the Council co-operate therewith in legislative business.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Since <span class="quote_inline">tomorrow</span> was the feast of Cronus, a day on which the Council did not meet (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.26</span>), this decree created a board of <span class="term">Nomothetae</span> without the consent of the full Council (for the <span class="term">Nomothetae</span>, see the article on <span class="term">Legislation</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Athenaeus mentions a decree that gives the Council a holiday for the festival of the Apaturia: <blockquote class="quote"><p>So that the Council might celebrate the Apaturia with the rest of the Athenians, according to the traditional ways, it has been decreed by the Council that the Councilors be dismissed for those days that the other offices have off, that is, five days starting from the day on which the Protenthae celebrate the opening feast of the Apaturia</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ὅπως ἂν ἡ βουλὴ ἄγῃ τὰ Ἀπατούρια μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων Ἀθηναίων κατὰ τὰ πάτρια, ἐψηφίσθαι τῇ βουλῇ ἀφεῖσθαι τοὺς βουλευτὰς τὰς ἡμέρας ἅσπερ καὶ αἱ ἄλλαι ἀρχαὶ αἱ ἀφεταὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς οἱ προτένθαι ἄγουσι πέντε ἡμέρας</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Athen. 4.171e</span>).</div>

<div class="p">An exchange between two characters in Aristophanes’ comedy, the <span class="titlem">Thesmophoriazousae</span>, suggests that the Council did not meet during the Thesmophoria: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Euripides: This day will decide whether it is all over with Euripides or not. Mnesilochus: But how? Neither the tribunals nor the Council are sitting, for it is the third day of the Thesmophoria.</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">Εὐριπίδης· τῇδε θἠμέρᾳ κριθήσεται εἴτ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἔστ᾽ ἔτι ζῶν εἴτ᾽ ἀπόλωλ᾽ Εὐριπίδης. Μνησίλοχος· καὶ πῶς; ἐπεὶ νῦν γ᾽ οὔτε τὰ δικαστήρια μέλλει δικάζειν οὔτε βουλῆς ἐσθ᾽ ἕδρα, ἐπεὶ τρίτη ᾽στὶ Θεσμοφορίων ἡ μέση.</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span> 77-81</span>).</div>

<div class="p">And Plutarch’s biography of Alcibiades describes the festival of the Plynteria, saying that <span class="quote_inline">the Athenians regard this days as the unluckiest of all days for business of any sort</span> (<span class="foreign">ὅθεν ἐν ταῖς μάλιστα τῶν ἀποφράδων τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην ἄπρακτον Ἀθηναῖοι νομίζουσιν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Alc.</span> 34.1</span>).</div>

<p>So, without going into the complexities of the Athenian civic and religious calendar, we can get an idea of the occasions on which the Council would not meet.</p>

<div class="p">In addition to regular meetings of the Council, called by the Presidents every day except for ‘exempt days’, the Council seems to have met after each meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. An anecdote from Aeschines suggests this. At a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, a man named Pamphilus, of the deme Acherdous, accused two men, Hegesandrus and Timarchus, of embezzling one thousand drachmas from the treasury of Athene (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.110</span>). Pamphillus then suggested that the matter be placed in the hands of the Council, but that should the Council fail to deal with the two men, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> should consider witholding the Council’s honorarium (<span class="foreign">δωρεά</span>) at the end of their year of service (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.111</span>). The account continues, <span class="quote_inline">After this, when the Council had returned to the Council House, they expelled him on the preliminary ballot, but took him back on the final vote</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.112</span>). The matter-of-fact way in which Aeschines reports this post-<span class="term">Assembly</span> meeting of the Council suggests that it was not an extraordinary event, but a regular one.</div>

<div class="p">The Council could meet in various locations. Inscriptional evidence shows that the Council might meet near the naval docks in Piraeus, or by the harbor wall if it was discussing naval matters (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 61.53</span>); <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 1629.248</span>). Andocides says that he and Cephisius were summoned to appear before the Council in the Temple of Demeter at Eleusis, the Eleusinium, <blockquote class="quote"><p>as it was there that the Council was to sit in conformity with a law of Solon’s, which lays down that a sitting shall be held in the Eleusinium on the day after the Mysteries</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.111</span>). Xenophon mentions one occasion on which, <span class="quote_inline">The Council of the Athenians happened to be meeting on the Acropolis</span> (<span class="foreign">τῶν δὲ Ἀθηναίων ἡ βουλὴ ἐτύγχανεν ἐν ἀκροπόλει καθημένη</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 6.4.20</span>).</div>

<p>But normally the Council met in the Council House, the Bouleuterion (<span class="foreign">βουλευτήριον</span>), in the Agora (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 25.23</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.1</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 330.30-31</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Inside the Council House the Councilors were seated on benches, with special benches for the Presidents (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 13.37</span>). There was a raised platform for speakers, the ‘bema’ (<span class="foreign">βῆμα</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Antiph. 6.40</span>). Antiphon also says that, <span class="quote_inline">In that very Council House was a shrine to Zeus the Councilor <span class="note" id="Note4"> [Zeus Boulaios]</span> and Athene the Councilor <span class="note" id="Note5"> [Athene Boulaia]</span></span> (<span class="foreign">ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ βουλευτηρίῳ Διὸς βουλαίου καὶ Ἀθηνᾶς βουλαίας ἱερόν ἐστι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Antiph. 6.45</span>).</div>

<p>There was also a hearth (<span class="foreign">ἑστία</span>) sacred to Hestia of the Council, or Hestia Boulaia. We hear of Demosthenes affirming his praise for a returning embassy by swearing to this goddess in the Council House (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.45</span>). But the sacred hearth was more broadly useful. As an altar to a god, it provided protection to whomever stood on it.</p>

<div class="p">Andocides describes one instance of this. The context is a speech related to a scandal in Athens in <span class="date">415 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>); a number of Athenians, the general Alcibiades most prominent among them, were accused of performing a parody of the Eleusynian Mysteries in a private residence (the scandal and subsequent legal actions are described at: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 6.28</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 6.53</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Alc.</span> 18.3</span>). The scandal provoked a crisis so great that the Council was granted special authority to conduct the investigation—Andocides says, of the Council at this time, <span class="quote_inline">it had full powers</span> (<span class="foreign">ἦν γὰρ αὐτοκράτωρ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.15</span>). During the investigation, Andocides tells us, a certain Diocles gave to the Council a list of forty-two Athenians whom he had seen at this mock ceremony: <blockquote class="quote"><p>and at the head of the forty-two appeared Mantitheus and Apsephion who were members of the Council and present at that very meeting. Peisander hereupon rose and moved that the decree passed in the archonship of Scamandrius be suspended and all whose names were on the list sent to the torture wheel, to ensure the discovery of everyone concerned before nightfall. The Council broke into shouts of approval. At that Mantitheus and Apsephion took sanctuary on the hearth, and appealed to be allowed to furnish guarantees and stand trial, instead of being tortured. They finally managed to gain their request; but no sooner had they provided their guarantees than they leapt on horseback and deserted to the enemy</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.43-44</span>). These two members of the Council invoked the protection of Hestia, to prevent their fellow Councilors from forcing them to submit to torture—the fact that the <span class="quote_inline">all powerful</span> Council was willing to suspend the decree that prohibited torturing Athenian citizens shows how seriously they took this crisis. And the protection of Hestia worked, although Mantitheus and Apsephion did not live up to their promise to stand trial but fled the city.</div>

<div class="p">The Hearth in the Council-chamber saved the life of the speaker in another speech by Andocides, during a turbulent meeting of the Council: <blockquote class="quote"><p>I saw the uproar into which the meeting was breaking, and knew that I was lost; so I sprang at once to the hearth and laid hold of the sacred emblems. That act, and that alone, was my salvation at the time; for although I stood disgraced in the eyes of the gods, they, it seems, had more pity on me than did men; when men were desirous of putting to death, it was the gods who saved my life</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 2.15</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Xenophon records how, during the <span class="term">Tyranny of the Thirty</span>, Theramenes tried to invoke this protection in the Council House. Critias, one of the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>, had moved to strike Theramenes from the roll of those enjoying citizen rights under the tyranny; Theramenes stood on the hearth in the Council House and called on the Councilors to protect his rights. He invoked the sanctity of the hearth to highlight the impiety of the tyrants: <blockquote class="quote"><p>To be sure, I know that this hearth will not help me, but I want to show that these <span class="term">Thirty</span> are not only unjust toward men, but I want to show that they are are most impious toward the gods</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.3.53</span>). As Theramenes predicted, the <span class="term">Thirty</span> did not honor Hestia’s shrine, and Critias ordered that he be arrested: <blockquote class="quote"><p>When Critias had spoken these words, Satyrus dragged Theramenes away from the altar, and his servants lent their aid. And Theramenes, as was natural, called upon gods and men to witness what was going on. But the Councilors kept quiet…</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.3.55</span>). Xenophon uses the tyrants’ failure to honor the sanctity of the Hearth to illustrate the depravity of the tyranny. Thus, even this negative example of the role played by Hestia Boulaia shows us the importance of the goddess and her Hearth for the functioning of the democratic Council.</div>

<p>This anecdote shows both the impiety of the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span> and the extent to which they had cowed the Council into submission, but also illustrates an important function of the Hestia Boulaia.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="MeetingAgenda"><h2><span class="headingNumber">9. </span><span class="head">Agenda for Meetings</span></h2>


<p>The Presidents were responsible for summoning the Council to meet (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.169</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 1629.247-251</span>). They were also responsible for setting the agenda (<span class="foreign">τὸ πρόγραμμα</span>) for the meeting (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.2</span>).</p>

<p>In the early years of the Athenian democracy, the Presidents (<span class="foreign">πρυτάνεις</span>) and their Chairman (<span class="foreign">ἐπιστάτης</span>) presided over the conduct of Council meetings (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Kn.</span> 674</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 50</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 196</span>). But in the <span class="date">4th century</span>, meetings were run by a different panel of officials. The Chairman would select by lot (<span class="foreign">κληροῖ</span>) a board of nine Proedroi (<span class="foreign">προέδροι ἐννέα</span>), one Councilor from each of the nine tribes of Athens (<span class="foreign">φυλαί</span>), omitting the tribe whose Councilors were currently serving as Presidents (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.2</span>). The Chairman would also select, from the nine Proedroi, one man to be Chairman of the Proedroi (<span class="foreign">ἐπιστάτς τῶν προέδρων</span>), and would hand over the agenda to these men (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.2</span>).</p>

<p>The agenda naturally varied greatly from meeting to meeting, but there were certainly regularly recurring items. For example, people owing money to the Athenian state, on certain kinds of contracts—taxes, mining leases, etc. (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 47.1</span>)—were supposed to make regular payments to the state, payable once in each Prytany (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 47.3</span>). So, the agenda for the first two meetings of the Council in each prytany included, as an item of business, the report of the ‘ten Receivers’ (<span class="foreign">ἀποδέκται δέκα</span>), who would read their records of who had and had not made his payment (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.1-2</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Also, an inscription from the <span class="date">4th century</span> records a decree stipulating that once in each Prytany, the Council must meet to discuss what work was necessary to keep the harbor and walls in goo repair, and how to pay for the work: <span class="quote_inline">…the Council is to confer, on one meeting day during each Prytany, concerning wall-building</span> (<span class="foreign">τὴν δὲ βουλὴν τὴν ἀεὶ βουλεύουσαν ἐν μίαν ἡμέραν τῆς πρυτανείας ἑκάστης βουλῆς ἕδραν περὶ τῶν τειχοποιικῶν</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 244</span>).</div>

<p>Matters of foreign policy, which were not predictable, were often the subject of special meetings of the Council, with only one issue on the agenda (see for example <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.185</span>).</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="MeetingProcedure"><h2><span class="headingNumber">10. </span><span class="head">Procedure for Meetings</span></h2>


<div class="p">The Presidents summoned the Council into session, then handed the conduct of the meeting over to the nine Proedroi, chosen at random (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.2</span>). The Proedroi received the agenda (<span class="foreign">πρόγραμμα</span>) from the Chairman, and as Aristotle says, <blockquote class="quote"><p>they, having received the agenda, ensure good order, put forward matters of business to be discussed, count the hands for any vote, manage all other things, and they are empowered to dismiss the meeting</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">οἱ δὲ παραλαβόντες τῆς τ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??εὐκοσμίας ἐπιμελοῦνται, καὶ ὑπὲρ ὧν δεῖ χρηματίζειν προτιθέασιν, καὶ τὰς χειροτονίας κρίνουσιν, καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πάντα διοικοῦσιν, καὶ τοῦ τ᾽ ἀφεῖναι κύριοί εἰσιν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.3</span>).</div>

<p>During the two meetings in each prytany when the finances of Athens were on the agenda, it seems that the "Receivers" (<span class="foreign">ἀποδέκται</span>), rather than the Proedroi, were in charge of the meeting (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.2</span>). On other occasions, the Councilors were joined by other officials, such as the Board of the <span class="term">Theoric Fund</span>, the Treasurer of the Military Fund, the Auctions Board (<span class="foreign">πωληταί</span>), or the nine Archons (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 47.2-48.1</span>).</p>

<p>Any Councilor could introduce a motion, but if the motion were later found to be illegal, that Councilor would be personally liable to indictment on a charge of ‘Illegal Proposal’ (<span class="foreign">γραφὴ παρανόμων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.34</span>; for a discussion of the charge of ‘Illegal Proposal’, see <span class="term">Legislation</span>).</p>

<p>Citizens who were not serving as Councilors could speak, with permission of the Presidents or the Proedroi (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Peace</span> 907</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 46.35-39</span>). A citizen could not introduce a motion into the meeting without arranging for a Councilor to sponsor the motion under his own name (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.125</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 243.6-8</span>). Aeschines, in his speeach against Ctesiphon, accuses Demosthenes of taking advantage of an inexperienced Councilor to have a motion of dubious legality introduced—the Councilor, after all, and not Demosthenes, would be liable to prosecution if the motion proved to be illegal (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.125</span>).</p>

<p>At least in the <span class="date">5th century</span>, the Generals had the right to make motions in their own names, without having a Councilor sponsor the motion (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">SEG</span> 10 86.47</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 27</span>).</p>


<div class="p">Demosthenes mentions the Council House, on an occasion when important news was being delivered to the Council, being <span class="quote_inline">full of private citizens</span> (<span class="foreign">τὸ γὰρ βουλευτήριον μεστὸν ἦν ἰδιωτῶν</span>), which shows that citizens could sometimes attend meetings as spectators (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.17</span>; see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.125</span>).</div>

<p>Foreigners could also attend meetings of the Council, but only with special permission. The inscription describing this privilege of ‘access’ (<span class="foreign">πρόσοδον</span>) is from the <span class="date">5th century</span>, so it specifies that permission must come from the Presidents; presumably, in the <span class="date">4th century</span>, permission would have come from the Proedroi (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 65.17-20</span>). Xenophon tells, however, of an occasion when the Council refused to admit a herald from Thebes into their presence, so permission was by no means automatic (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 6.4.20</span>).</p>

<p>Spectators were separated from the Councilors by a railing, and they probably had to stand, while the Councilors sat (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Kn.</span> 675</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.3.50</span>).</p>

<div class="p">There was a fence (<span class="foreign">κιγκλίς</span>) around the Council House, and when the Council was discussing any secret matter all spectators were kept outside the fence. Because of the fence, Demosthenes, says, the Council <span class="quote_inline">is master of all their secrets, and no private citizens may enter</span> (<span class="foreign">τῶν ἀπορρήτων κυρίαν εἶναι, καὶ μὴ τοὺς ἰδιώτας ἐπεισιέναι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 25.23</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.125</span>).</div>

<p>The Council voted on matters by show of hands (<span class="foreign">χειροτονία</span>), with the Proedroi judging the outcome (<span class="foreign">κρίνουσι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.3</span>). When the business of the meeting was complete, the meeting was brought to a close by the Presidents (in the <span class="date">5th century</span>: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Kn.</span> 674</span>), or by the Proedroi (in the 4th century: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.3</span>).</p>

<p>Any motion that passed became a decree, and these Council decrees (<span class="foreign">ψηφίσματα τῆς βουλῆς</span>) are the subject of the next sections.</p>
</div>


<div class="Section" id="DecreesGeneral"><h2><span class="headingNumber">11. </span><span class="head">Council Decrees</span></h2>


<div class="p">The Council and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could both issue decrees (<span class="foreign">ψηφίσματα</span>, in the plural; <span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span> in the singular). Lysias refers to <span class="quote_inline">decrees of the Council and of the People</span> (<span class="foreign">τὰ ψηφίσματα τὰ ἐκ τῆς βουλῆς καὶ τοῦ δήμου</span>) to refer to both kinds of decrees collectively (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 13.50</span>). Demosthenes refers to <span class="quote_inline">the decrees of the People and of the Council of 500</span> (<span class="foreign">τὰ ψηφίσματα τὰ τοῦ δήμου καὶ τῆς βουλῆς τῶν πεντακοσίων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.179</span>). Many decrees were the work of both the Council and the ‘People’ (that is, the <span class="term">Assembly</span>); the texts of these would begin with the phrase, <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the Council and the People…</span> (<span class="foreign">ἔδοξε τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῷ δήμῳ</span>) (see, for example, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.96</span>).</div>

<div class="p">When Athenian citizens were selected to serve as jurors, before taking their places in the <span class="term">court</span>, they swore an oath to abide by <span class="quote_inline">the laws and decrees of the People of Athens and of the Council of 500</span> (<span class="foreign">ψηφιοῦμαι κατὰ τοὺς νόμους καὶ τὰ ψηφίσματα τοῦ δήμου τοῦ Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῆς βουλῆς τῶν πεντακοσίων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.149</span>). But it is important to note that decrees, whether of the People in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> or of the Council, were not the same as laws. The orators make frequent reference to the legal principle that <span class="quote_inline">no decree, either of the Council or of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, shall have authority superior to a law</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.87</span>; see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.87</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.89</span>, where the principle is repeated almost word-for-word).</div>

<div class="p">The process by which the Athenian democracy made laws is discussed in the article on <span class="term">Legislation</span>, and the Council’s role in that process is discussed below, in the section on <span class="quote_inline">The Council and the Nomothetae.</span> But while the laws (<span class="foreign">νόμοι</span>) had authority over decrees (<span class="foreign">ψηφίσματα</span>), much of the business of the Athenian democracy was conducted by means of decrees.</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="CouncilDecrees"><h2><span class="headingNumber">12. </span><span class="head">Independent Action</span></h2>


<div class="p">In some circumstances, the Council could pass decrees that went into effect directly, without the participation of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. For example, a speech by Demosthenes deals with the case of a man named Theophemus, who had served as trierarch (<span class="foreign">τριήραρχος</span>), an official responsible for the upkeep of a warship. At the end of Theophemus’ term, the speaker alleges, he failed to return some of the equipment that belonged to the ship. The speaker says that he brought this problem to the Council. He then approached Theophemus and demanded the equipment, <span class="quote_inline">since now this decree had passed in the Council, and no one had charged it with illegality, and it had gone into effect</span> (<span class="foreign">γενομένου τοίνυν τοῦ ψηφίσματος τούτου ἐν τῇ βουλῇ, καὶ οὐδενὸς γραφομένου παρανόμων, ἀλλὰ κυρίου ὄντος</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.33-34</span>). So in this case, the regulation of trierarchs, the Council’s decrees were immediately valid.</div>

<div class="p">Inscriptions use special language to indicate that a decree came from the Council, as in the case of an inscription recording a Council decree establishing a special relationship between certain foreigners and the Athenian state: <blockquote class="quote"><p>It seemed best to the Council, when the tribe of Oineis held the Presidency, and Dexippus was secretary, and Democles was Chairman, and Monippides made the motion…</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ἔδοξεν τῆι βολῆι· Οἰνηῒς ἐπρυτάνευε, Δεξίθεος ἐγραμμάτευε, Δημοκλῆς ἐπεστάτε· Μονιππίδης εἶπε·</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 6</span>). Because the inscription does says <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the Council,</span> as opposed to "…to the Council and the People", we can conclude that this was another matter on which the Council could act independently.</div>

<p>A speech by the orator Isaeus refers to decrees passed by the Council concerning an individual woman, who (according to the speaker) was not allowed to participate in certain religious rites because of reputation for scandalous behavior (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isaeus 6.49-50</span>).</p>

<div class="p">A passage in Athenaeus suggests that the Council could give itself a vacation by means of a Council decree: <blockquote class="quote"><p>So that the Council might celebrate the Apaturia with the rest of the Athenians, according to the traditional ways, it has been decreed by the Council that the Councilors be dismissed for those days that the other offices have off, that is, five days starting from the day on which the Protenthae celebrate the opening feast of the Apaturia</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ὅπως ἂν ἡ βουλὴ ἄγῃ τὰ Ἀπατούρια μετὰ τῶν ἄλλων Ἀθηναίων κατὰ τὰ πάτρια, ἐψηφίσθαι τῇ βουλῇ ἀφεῖσθαι τοὺς βουλευτὰς τὰς ἡμέρας ἅσπερ καὶ αἱ ἄλλαι ἀρχαὶ αἱ ἀφεταὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς οἱ προτένθαι ἄγουσι πέντε ἡμέρας</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Athen. 4.171e</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The Council could issue decrees regarding official embassies from Athens to other states. The orator Aeschines describes an embassy of which he was a member, and how its departure from Athens was delayed, and cites a decree of the Council as evidence supporting his assertion: <blockquote class="quote"><p>As witness of this I will present the Council, for there is a decree of theirs which commands the ambassadors to set out in order to receive the oaths. Please read the decree of the Council</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">καὶ τούτου τὴν βουλὴν μάρτυρα ὑμῖν παρέξομαι· ἔστι γὰρ αὐτῆς ψήφισμα, ὃ κελεύει ἀπιέναι τοὺς πρέσβεις ἐπὶ τοὺς ὅρκους. καί μοι λέγε τὸ τῆς βουλῆς ψήφισμα.</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.91</span>).</div>

<div class="p">There is some evidence for more substantial decisions made by the Council alone. An inscription recording a <span class="quote_inline">treaty of military alliance between the Eretrians and the Athenians</span> (<span class="foreign">Ἐρετριέων συμμαχία καὶ Ἀθηναίων</span>) begins with the phrase <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the Council</span> (<span class="foreign">ἔδοξεν τῆι βολῆι</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 16</span>). Had the <span class="term">Assembly</span> been involved in this treaty, we would expect to see the phrase <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the Council and the People.</span> Likewise, another inscription having to do with relationships between Athens and Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, also begins <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the Council</span> (<span class="foreign">ἔδοξεν τῆι βολῆι</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 18</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Nevertheless, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> of all Athenian citizens was the definitive institution of the democracy, and the democracy carefully guarded against giving the Council of 500 too much authority. Early in the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>, the orator Lysias expresses lingering suspicion about the Council and its role in the oligarchic coup of <span class="date">411 BCE</span> and the <span class="term">Tyranny</span> imposed by the Spartans in <span class="date">404 BCE</span> (these events are described more fully in the article on the <span class="term">history of the Council</span>): <blockquote class="quote"><p>The Council which held session before the time of the <span class="term">Thirty</span> had been corrupted, and its appetite for oligarchy, as you know, was very keen. For proof of it you have the fact that the majority of that Council had seats in the subsequent Council under the <span class="term">Thirty</span>. And what is my reason for making these remarks to you? That you may know that the decrees issued by that Council were all designed, not in loyalty to you, but for the subversion of your democracy, and that you may study them as thus exposed</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 13.19-20</span>). According to Lysias, even in the period between the oligarchy and the tyranny, when Athens was democratic, the Council was dominated by Athenians who favored oligarchy.</div>

<p>It is not surprising, then, that the Council under the democracy had only limited authority to pass resolutions on its own, without the approval or cooperation of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. We have an inscription that lists various kinds of decisions that the Council was not allowed to make without getting the approval of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>; these include matters of war and peace, death sentences, especially large fines, stripping an Athenian of <span class="term">citizenship</span>, and perhaps (the inscription’s fragmentary state makes this uncertain) the administration of public finances and foreign policy (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 105</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Often, it seems, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> would pass a broad decree, and leave management of the details to the Council. So, a decree of the Council and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">ἔδοξεν τῆι βουλῆι καὶ τῶι δήμωι</span>), recorded on an inscription dating to around <span class="date">356 BCE</span>, includes the provision that, <span class="quote_inline">If this decree should omit anything, the Council is authorized to act</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐὰν δέ του προσδεήηι τόδε τὸ ψήφισμα, τὴν βουλὴν κυρίαν εἶναι</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 127.34-35 = Tod 157</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl">M.N. Tod, <span class="titlem">A Selection of Greek Historical Inscriptions</span>, vol. 2 [Oxford, 1948] 168</span>). This decree, establishing an alliance between Athens and the kings of Thrace, Illyria, and Paeonia, is also mentioned at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.86</span>.</div>

<div class="p">Another inscription also gives the Council the right to manage details by decree, but with more cautious language. The decree of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, in <span class="date">325</span> or <span class="date">324 BCE</span>, has to do with the Athenian fleet and a colony that the Athenians were sending out to the Adriatic sea (<span class="foreign">περὶ τῆς εἰς τὸν Ἀδρίαν ἀποικίας</span>). Here, the decree grants the Council limited powers to manage details, but only within the terms established by the <span class="term">Assembly</span>: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Should this decree regarding the expedition omit anything, the Council is authorized to issued decrees, as long as it does not violate any of the decrees passed by the People</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ἐὰν δέ τοῦ προσδέει τόδε τὸ ψήφισμα τῶν περὶ τὸν ἀπόστολον, τὴν βουλὴν κυρίαν εἶναι ψηφίζεσθαι μὴ λύουσαν μηθὲν τῶν ἐψηφισμένων τῶι δήμωι</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 1629.264-9 = Tod 200</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl">M.N. Tod, <span class="titlem">A Selection of Greek Historical Inscriptions</span>, vol. 2 [Oxford, 1948] 284</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Demosthenes notes another, special, circumstance in which the Council could act without involving the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. He describes an instance when all of the regularly scheduled meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> in one month had passed, but there was still a need for a decree authorizing an embassy to depart from Athens to meet with Philip of Macedon: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Finding that you had got to the end of the regular <span class="term">Assemblies</span>, and that there was no meeting left, and observing that the envoys were still wasting time at Athens instead of starting at once, I proposed a decree as a member of the Council, to which the <span class="term">Assembly</span> had given authority, directing the envoys to sail immediately, and the general Proxenus to convey them to any place in which he should ascertain that Philip was to be found. I drafted it, as I now read it, in those express terms</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.154</span>). So if there were pressing business, and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could not meet, the Council could act on its own.</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="ProbouleumataIntro"><h2><span class="headingNumber">13. </span><span class="head">Introduction to Probouleumata</span></h2>


<p>More important than any other function of the Council was its role in preparing the agenda for meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, where all Athenian citizens gathered to discuss and vote on decrees.</p>

<div class="p">Plutarch describes the historical foundations of this role, which he says dates back to the time of Solon, who established a body of laws for Athens in the <span class="date">6th century BCE</span>, before the classical Democracy was in place (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span></span>). Regarding Solon’s version of the Council, Plutarch says: <blockquote class="quote"><p>After he had established the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, consisting of those who had been archons year by year (and he himself was a member of this body since he had been archon), he observed that the common people were uneasy and bold in consequence of their release from debt, and therefore established another council besides, consisting of four hundred men, one hundred chosen from each of the four tribes. These were to deliberate on public matters before the people did, and were not to allow any matter to come before the popular <span class="term">assembly</span> without such previous deliberation.</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">συστησάμενος δὲ τὴν ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ βουλὴν ἐκ τῶν κατ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἐνιαυτὸν ἀρχόντων, ἧς διὰ τὸ ἄρξαι καὶ αὐτὸς μετεῖχεν, ἔτι δ᾽ ὁρῶν τὸν δῆμον οἰδοῦντα καὶ θρασυνόμενον τῇ τῶν χρεῶν ἀφέσει, δευτέραν προσκατένειμε βουλήν, ἀπὸ φυλῆς ἑκάστης, τεττάρων οὐσῶν, ἑκατὸν ἄνδρας ἐπιλεξάμενος, οὓς προβουλεύειν ἔταξε τοῦ δήμου καὶ μηδὲν ἐᾶν ἀπροβούλευτον εἰς ἐκκλησίαν εἰσφέρεσθαι.</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.1</span>).</div>

<div class="p">So Solon’s Council was intended to reduce the <span class="quote_inline">uneasiness</span> and <span class="quote_inline">boldness</span> of the Athenian people, by introducing an institution that mediated between the People and the decrees they might chose to pass. This was the role that the Council of the 500 played in the democracy as well.</div>

<div class="p">Aristotle says that the Council originally had sovereign power over many aspects of the democracy (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.1-3</span>), but after the Council condemned a man named Lysimachus to death, without the benefit of a trial by jury, the Athenian people rescued the man and limited most of the powers of the Council. <blockquote class="quote"><p>In these matters therefore the Council is not sovereign, but it prepares resolutions for the People, and the People cannot pass any measures that have not been prepared by the Council and published in writing in advance by the Presidents; for the proposer who carries such a measure is automatically liable to penalty by indictment for Illegal Proposal</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">τούτων μὲν οὖν ἄκυρός ἐστιν ἡ βουλή· προβουλεύει δ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??εἰς τὸν δῆμον, καὶ οὐκ ἔξεστιν οὐδὲν ἀπροβούλευτον οὐδ᾽ ὅ τι ἂν μὴ προγράψωσιν οἱ πρυτάνεις ψηφίσασθαι τῷ δήμῳ. κατ᾽ αὐτὰ γὰρ ταῦτα ἔνοχός ἐστιν ὁ νικήσας γραφῇ παρανόμων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.4</span>; for discussion of indictment for ‘Illegal Procedure’, see <span class="term">Legislation</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The Council would vote on ‘preliminary decrees’ (<span class="foreign">προβουλεύματα</span>, or in the singular, <span class="foreign">προβούλευμα</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.92</span>). According to the <span class="date">10th century CE</span> lexicon of the Greek language, the <span class="titlem">Suda</span>, a ‘probouleuma’ was <span class="quote_inline">What has been voted on by the Council before being presented to the People</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Suda pi,2349</span>). A passage from the orator Demosthenes’ speech against Neaira illustrates how a probouleuma worked:</div>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>You were at that time on the point of sending your entire force to Euboea and Olynthus, and Apollodorus, being one of its members, brought forward in the Council a motion, and carried it as a preliminary decree (<span class="foreign">προβούλευμα</span>) to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, proposing that the people should decide whether the funds remaining over from the state’s expenditure should be used for military purposes or for public spectacles. For the laws prescribed that, when there was war, the funds remaining over from state expenditures should be devoted to military purposes, and Apollodorus believed that the people ought to have power to do what they pleased with their own; and he had sworn that, as member of the Council, he would act for the best interests of the Athenian people, as you all bore witness at that crisis</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.4</span>).</div>

<p>In this case, an existing law required that any surplus funds in the treasury of Athens should be used for military purposes. But despite this law, Apollodorus wanted the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to discuss how to spend the funds. So Apollodorus brought the matter to the Council, which voted to create a preliminary decree. The council approved the preliminary decree. This preliminary decree allowed the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to discuss how to spend the money. Demosthenes goes on to say that the <span class="term">Assembly</span> voted, unanimously, to spend the money on the military (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.5</span>).</p>

<p>So, after this lengthy procedure, the Athenian democracy did with its money precisely what an existing law required. But the mechanism of the Council, its <span class="term">probouleuma</span> (<span class="foreign">προβούλευμα</span>), and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> allowed all of the citizens to deliberate, in an orderly manner, on the extent to which the existing law was appropriate under these circumstances, a war in Euboea and around Olynthus.</p>

<p>On this one inscription we see the whole legislative process. In the first prytany of the year, Antidotos, a councillor, made a motion before the Council regarding this request by the Citians. One of the Proedroi in charge of running the meeting of the Council put the matter to a vote. The Council voted to send the matter along to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> without making any recommendation to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> for or against the Citians’ patron goddess, where natives of Cyprus could worship while they were visiting or living in Athens (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 337</span>; source for date, M.N. Tod, <span class="titlem">A Selection of Greek Historical Inscriptions</span>, vol. 2 [Oxford, 1948] 250).</p>

<p>It is important to note that the text and translation given here omit any indication of how the inscription actually looked, and the extent to which modern editors have filled in missing sections; what appears here is considerably cleaned up. It can serve to illustrate the workings of the Council, but should not be taken as indicative of the proper way to present and read an inscription.</p>

<p>Here is the inscription, <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 337</span>:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Gods.

When Nikokrates was archon, in the second Prytany (that of the tribe Pandionis): Phanostratos from the deme Philaidai, one of the Proedroi, put this matter to the vote: The People decided (after Lycurgus, son of Lycophron, of the deme Boutadai made the motion): Concerning the things for which the Citian merchants resolved to petition, lawfully, asking the People for the use of a plot of land on which they might build a temple of Aphrodite, it has seemed best to the People to give to the merchants of the Citians the use of a plot of land on which they might build a temple of Aphrodite, just as also the Egyptians built the temple of Isis.</p></blockquote></div>

</div>

<div class="Section" id="ProbouleumataExceptions"><h2><span class="headingNumber">14. </span><span class="head">Exceptional Decrees</span></h2>


<div class="p">In one of Demosthenes’ speeches, we can see that there could be disagreement over the absolute necessity of a preliminary decree from the Council, before any business could be discussed in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The issue at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 22.5</span> was whether the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could vote a gift of thanks to the members of the Council at the end of their year of service. Demosthenes claims that a certain Androtion has defended the practice of voting for such an award, in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, without first getting a Preliminary Decree on the matter from the Council. It is not hard to see why this would seem reasonable—it would surely be awkward to ask the Council to pass a decree awarding a gift of thanks to itself. But, Demosthenes argues, that is precisely what <em>should</em> happen: <blockquote class="quote"><p>There is one plea which he thinks a clever defence of the omission of the Preliminary Decree. There is a law, he says, that if the Council by its performance of its duties seems to deserve a reward, that reward shall be presented by the People <span class="note" id="Note6"> [i.e. the <span class="term">Assembly</span>]</span>. That question, he says, the chairman of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> put, the People voted, and it was carried. In this case, he says, there is no need of a Preliminary Decree, because what was done was in accordance with law. But I take the exactly contrary view—and I think you will agree with me—that the Preliminary Decrees should only be proposed concerning matters prescribed by the laws, because, where no laws are laid down, surely no proposal whatever is admissible</p></blockquote><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"> (Dem. 22.5).</span></div>

<p>So, if there was already a law (<span class="foreign">νόμος</span>) allowing the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to do something, did the <span class="term">Assembly</span> nevertheless need a Preliminary Decree? Demosthenes says so, and it does make sense. The law might make it legal for the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to award the Council a gift of thanks from time to time, but it remained to be decided whether such a gift was appropriate in any given year. That decision could only be made through discussion in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and such discussion could problably not take place without a Preliminary Decree from the Council.</p>

<p>Demosthenes goes on to note that in previous years the <span class="term">Assembly</span> had voted awards to the Council without a preliminary decree (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 22.6</span>), but condemns that historical precedent as being illegal. It is very likely that Demosthenes is correct—that such an action in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was unconstitutional—but that no member of the Council would be so churlish as to object to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>’s voting them a gift of thanks, even without a <span class="term">Probouleuma</span>.</p> 

<p>When Aristotle describes meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, he mentions certain regular pieces of business that were to be conducted at each <span class="foreign">κυρία ἐκκλησία</span>, that is, each of the four regular meetings that took place during each prytany (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.4</span>); this business included votes of confidence in officials, matters of the food supply and security, a public invitation for any citizen to make certain kinds of accusations, and various public announcements (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.5-6</span> also specifies other regular business that was supposed to take place only once a year).</p>

<div class="p">We do not know whether this business was an exception to the rule that <span class="quote_inline">nothing is permitted <span class="note" id="Note7"> [to happen in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>]</span> without a Preliminary Decree from the Council</span> (<span class="foreign">οὐκ ἔξεστιν οὐδὲν ἀπροβούλευτον</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.4</span>). Perhaps these were exceptions to that rule that allowed ordinary citizens to participate, in certain ways, in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> without needing the intervention of the Council. Or, perhaps the Council automatically included these orders of business when it drew up the agendas for those regular meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>.</div>

<p>Since Aristotle mentions these regularly occuring pieces of business for the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.4-5</span>) immediately after describing how the Council’s job was to prepare the agenda for meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.4</span>), it seems more likely that the Council automatically put that business on the <span class="term">Assembly</span>’s agenda.</p>

<div class="p">Two of these regular items of business that Aristotle mentions are particularly important for the democratic governance of Athens. First, he mentions that, at one meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> during each prytany, there was supposed to be the opportunity <span class="quote_inline">on that day for whoever wished to make public accusations</span> (<span class="foreign">τὰς εἰσαγγελίας ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοὺς βουλομένους ποιεῖσθαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.4</span>). And in the sixth prytany, at one of the meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, there was supposed to be an opportunity for people to bring <blockquote class="quote"><p>accusations against people, either Athenians or resident foreigners, informing on others maliciously (not more than three accusations against Athenians and three against foreigners), and and against anyone who promised to do something for the People but did not do it</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">καὶ συκοφαντῶν προβολὰς τῶν Ἀθηναίων καὶ τῶν μετοίκων μέχρι τριῶν ἑκατέρων, κἄν τις ὑποσχόμενός τι μὴ ποιήσῃ τῷ δήμῳ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.5</span>). And at one meeting (Aristotle does not say which one) there was the opportunity <blockquote class="quote"><p>for supplications, in which whoever wants to may place a suppliant-branch [<span class="foreign">ἱκετηρίαν</span>] and make a request of the People regarding whatever he wishes, either public business or private business</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ταῖς ἱκετηρίαις, ἐν ᾗ θεὶς ὁ βουλόμενος ἱκετηρίαν, ὑπὲρ ὧν ἂν βούληται καὶ ἰδίων καὶ δημοσίων, διαλέξεται πρὸς τὸν δῆμον</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.6</span>). <span class="note" id="Note8"> [The business of supplication is discussed at greater length in the article on the <span class="term">Assembly</span>.]</span></div>

<p>By having these as regular orders of business at pre-determined points in the year, the Athenian democracy allowed its citizens to make public complaints about citizens acting illegally or failing to live up to their responsibilities, to lodge complaints against citizens or foreigners misusing the court system, or simply make a request of the democratic government. But while most business had to go to the Council before appearing before the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, in at least these matters citizens had guaranteed access to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, without having to seek special permission from the Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="ProbouleumataDenied"><h2><span class="headingNumber">15. </span><span class="head">Probouleumata Voted Down</span></h2>


<p>Because, in other matters, the Council could, and did, occasionally refuse to approve a <span class="term">probouleuma</span>, it was important to guarantee citizens’ access to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, so they could make accusations against those abusing or wrongly manipulating the system.</p>

<p>Herodotus describes one such occasion, from the early <span class="date">5th century</span>, that was particularly dramatic. In <span class="date">479 BCE</span>, the Persians invaded Greece and occupied Athens; the Athenians had evacuated the city and had taken refuge on the island of Salamis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 9.3.2</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). The Persian general Mardonius sent an envoy to the Council of the Athenians, which was still conducting business on the island. This envoy, a man named Murychides from the Hellespont, asked if the Athenians would surrender to Persia now that their city was occupied (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 9.5.1</span>). Herodotus describes what happened when the Councilors heard the Persian proposal:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Then Lycidas, one of the Councilors, said that it seemed best to him to receive the offer brought to them by Murychides and lay it before the People <span class="note" id="Note9"> [that is, the <span class="term">Assembly</span>]</span>. This was the opinion which he declared, either because he had been bribed by Mardonius, or because the plan pleased him. The Athenians in the Council were, however, very angry; so too were those outside when they heard of it. They made a ring round Lycidas and stoned him to death. Murychides the Hellespontian, however, they permitted to depart unharmed. There was much noise at Salamis over the business of Lycidas; and when the Athenian women learned what was afoot, one calling to another and bidding her follow, they went on their own impetus to the house of Lycidas and stoned to death his wife and his children</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 9.5.1-3</span>).</div>

<p>This story shows us several interesting things. First, that even under these extraordinary circumstances—the city occupied and in flames, the Athenians as refugees on a small island—the mechanisms of the Athenian democracy continued to function in a (more-or-less) orderly fashion. The envoy came to the Council, which was normal (the Council’s role in foreign policy is described below). A Councilor proposed a Preliminary Decree which would allow the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to discuss the proposal. The Council rejected the proposed probouleuma. At this point, the normal functioning of the democracy broke down, no doubt because of the difficult circumstances and high emotions. The Councilors, and others, were not merely satisfied with voting down Lycidas’ motion, but stoned the man to death—a violent equivalent to a prosecution for ‘illegal motion’.</p>

<p>It is worth mentioning that the orator Lycurgus, when describing these events, is careful to note that the Councilors removed the wreaths from their heads before stoning Lycidas to death (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lyc. 1.122</span>). If this is true, then the Councilors were being very careful to separate their actions as an angry mob from their duties as representatives of the democracy—even if this is an embelishment to the story, it shows that later Athenians wanted to emphasize that killing a Councilor for moving an unpopular probouleuma was <em>not</em> a legitimate course of action.</p>

<div class="p">One other thing emerges from this story. Herodotus says that <span class="quote_inline">The Athenians in the Council were, however, very angry; so too were those outside when they heard of it</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 9.5.2</span>). Since citizens (and sometimes non-citizens) could often come to meetings of the Council as spectators, the Athenians generally would often know which matters of business were proposed as probouleumata, which were passed on to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and which ones were not. So while the Council could prevent the <span class="term">Assembly</span> from discussing some problem or issue by failing to approve a preliminary decree, they could not usually, prevent their fellow citizens from knowing of that issue’s existance.</div>

<div class="p">The historian Xenophon describes a similar incident, one slightly less extreme, from the last days of the Peloponnesian War, at the end of the <span class="date">5th century</span>. Then, when the Spartans has beseiged Athens from land and sea, <blockquote class="quote"><p>when Archestratus said in the Council that it was best to make peace with the Lacedaemonians <span class="note" id="Note10"> [that is, the Spartans]</span> on the terms they offered—and the terms were that they should tear down a portion ten stadia long <span class="note" id="Note11"> [slightly more than one mile]</span> of each of the two Long Walls—he was thrown into prison, and a decree was passed forbidding the making of a proposal of this sort</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.2.15</span>). Since a step as momentous as surrendering and tearing down the walls would surely have required the approval of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, Archestratus must have proposed that the Council approve a probouleuma on this issue. Not only did this proposal fail, but the Council made it illegal for anyone even to make such a proposal.</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="ProbouleumataOpenAndClosed"><h2><span class="headingNumber">16. </span><span class="head">‘Open’ and ‘Closed’ Probouleumata</span></h2>


<p>Sometimes the Council would make a Preliminary Decree, a probouleuma, that gave the <span class="term">Assembly</span> a real choice between several courses of action, an ‘open’ probouleuma. At other times, the Council would make a specific recommendation to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, a ‘concrete’ probouleuma.</p>

<div class="p">For an example of an open probouleuma, in a speech to an Athenian jury, Demosthenes describes this Preliminary Decree that came before the <span class="term">Assembly</span>: <blockquote class="quote"><p>You were at that time on the point of sending your entire army to Euboea and Olynthus, and Apollodorus, being a member of the Council, brought forward in the Council a bill, and carried it as a Preliminary Decree to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>; the Preliminary Decree proposed that the People should decide whether the funds remaining over from the state’s expenditure should be used for military purposes or for public spectacles. For the laws prescribed that, when there was war, the funds remaining over from state expenditures should be devoted to military purposes, and Apollodorus believed that the people ought to have power to do what they pleased with their own.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.4</span>). Here the Council presented the <span class="term">Assembly</span> with two choices, but did not recommend which choice the People should make.</div>

<div class="p">An even more dramatic example comes from <span class="date">339 BCE</span>, when Philip of Macedon had captured the city of Elatea. Demosthenes decribes what happened: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Evening had already fallen when a messenger arrived bringing to the presiding Councilors the news that Elatea had been taken. They were sitting at supper, but they instantly rose from their meal, cleared the booths in the marketplace of their occupants, and unfolded the hurdles, while others summoned the generals and ordered the trumpeter to come. The commotion spread through the whole city. At daybreak on the next day the Prytanes summoned the Council to the Council House, and the citizens flocked to the place of assembly. Before the Council could introduce the business and prepare the agenda, the whole body of citizens had taken their places on the hill. The Council arrived, the presiding Councilors formally reported the intelligence they had received, and the courier was introduced. As soon as he had told his tale, the marshal put the question, Who wishes to speak? No one came forward.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.169-170</span>).</div>

<p>On the morning that Demosthenes describes, then, the Council met quickly to pass a probouleuma. The orator does not tell us of its contents, but it certainly seems that the Council did not make any specific recommendations. Instead, it seems most likely that the probouleuma merely put the military crisis on the agenda of the special meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and that any citizen was welcomed to make a specific proposal (which none was ready to do, evidently).</p>

<div class="p">A very clear example of a ‘concrete’ Preliminary Decree comes from a speech by Aeschines <em>about</em> Demosthenes. According to Aeschines, Demosthenes moved a probouleuma in the Council, which was then sent along to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, that made a very specific recommendation: <blockquote class="quote"><p><span class="quote_inline">The hieromnemon <span class="note" id="Note12"> [an official envoy sent on embassies of a religous nature]</span> of the Athenians,</span> it says, <span class="quote_inline">and the pylagori <span class="note" id="Note13"> [another religious envoy]</span> who are at the time in office, shall go to Thermopylae and Delphi at the times appointed by our fathers</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.126</span>). This was a specific proposal, for the <span class="term">Assembly</span> either to accept or to reject. Other ‘concrete’ probouleumata appear in the sources. Demosthenes mentions one that put the matter of selling naval equipment to Philip of Macedon; the probouleuma invited the <span class="term">Assembly</span> either to make doing so a capital offense, or not (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.286</span>). </div>

<p>It may have been that even under a ‘concrete’ Preliminary Decree, once the business was on the floor of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, citizens could propose alternative solutions to those suggested by the Council in the original probouleuma. A passage from a speech by Aeschines suggests this (the details of the historical situation are not important here):</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Amyntor in support of Aeschines testifies that when the people were deliberating on the subject of the alliance with Philip, according to the decree of Demosthenes, in the second meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, when no opportunity was given to address the people, but when the decrees concerning the peace and alliance were being put to vote, at that meeting Demosthenes was sitting by the side of the witness, and showed him a decree, over which the name of Demosthenes stood written; and that he consulted him as to whether he should hand it to the presiding officers to put to vote; this decree contained the terms on which Demosthenes moved that peace and alliance he made, and these terms were identical with the terms which Philocrates had moved.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.167-168</span>)</div>

<p>Here is what seems to be happening in this passage. There was a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. One item on the agenda (thus having been the subject of a Preliminary Decree from the Council) was a peace treaty with Philip of Macedon. Because Aeschines says that no one had the opportunity to address the People (that is, the <span class="term">Assembly</span>), we can assume that this was a concrete probouleuma, one making a specific recommendation for the People either to approve or reject. But Demosthenes had already written <em>another</em> decree (a <span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span>, ‘something to be voted on by the <span class="term">Assembly</span>’, not a probouleuma from the Council) and was debating whether to introduce it.</p>

<p>From this, it would seem that once a piece of business got to <span class="term">Assembly</span>, the Athenian people could debate and vote on related suggestions made on the spot, not merely the course of action recommended by the Council.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="ProbouleumataTimeLimit"><h2><span class="headingNumber">17. </span><span class="head">Expiration of Probouleumata</span></h2>


<div class="p">Demosthenes mentions a law that set an expiration-date of one year for any probouleuma that was not voted on by the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.92</span>). The circumstances of this piece of evidence, however, and the way Demosthenes mentions it, are confusing. A man named Aristocrates, while serving as Councilor, had moved a probouleuma in the Council, awarding honors on a man named Charidemus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.90</span>). Later, Demosthenes wrote a speech prosecuting Euthycles on a charge of <span class="foreign">γραφὴ παρανόμων</span>, or ‘illegal proposal’ (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.100</span>). In his speech, Demosthenes anticipates the kinds of arguments Aristocrates might use to defend himself. At one point, Demosthenes says: <blockquote class="quote"><p>I imagine that he will use the following argument, and that he will try very hard to mislead you on this point. The decree, he will urge, is invalid because it is merely a Preliminary Decree (<span class="foreign">προβούλευμα</span>) and the law provides that votes of the Council shall be in force for one year only; therefore, if you acquit him today, the commonwealth can take no harm in respect of his decree.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.92</span>). In other words, Arisocrates will try to argue that he cannot be prosecuted for making an illegal motion, since the motion he made more than a year ago is no longer in force.</div>

<p>If we can take this as evidence, then it seems that under certain circumstances a probouleuma would fail to come up for discussion for more than a year after the Council passed it, and it would then expire.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Legislation"><h2><span class="headingNumber">18. </span><span class="head">Legislation</span></h2>


<p>The Council played an important role in the process of legislation, or <span class="term">‘nomothesia’</span> (<span class="foreign">νομοθεσία</span>). This is a complex subject, and this discussion of the Athenian Council is not the place to describe legislation in detail (for a more complete description, based on the ancient sources, see the article on <span class="term">Legislation</span>). But a short summary of the process will help, as we look at how the Council participated in making laws for the Athenian Democracy.</p>

<div class="p">Athenians in the <span class="date">4th century</span> were governed by laws (<span class="foreign">νόμοι</span>, or <span class="foreign">νόμος</span> in the singular) and decrees (<span class="foreign">ψήφισματα</span>, or <span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span> in the singular). Decrees were passed by a vote of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, of the Council, or both. Laws came into being by a more complicated process. Laws took precedence over Decrees. Demosthenes says, <span class="quote_inline">No decree, either of the Council or the <span class="term">Assembly</span> shall have more authority than a law</span> (<span class="foreign">ψήφισμα δὲ μηδὲν μήτε βουλῆς μήτε δήμου νόμου κυριώτερον εἶναι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.87</span>). Anyone who proposed a decree in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> that contradicted an existing law was subject to prosecution on a charge of ‘Illegal Proposal’ (<span class="foreign">γραφὴ παρανόμων</span>). Laws were passed through a process called ‘nomothesia’ (<span class="foreign">νομοθεσία</span>) or ‘legislation’. Each year the <span class="term">Assembly</span> met to discuss the current body of laws. Any citizen could propose a change in the laws, but could only propose the repeal of a law if he suggested another law to replace the repealed law. If the <span class="term">Assembly</span> decided to change the laws, a board of ‘Nomothetai’ (<span class="foreign">νομοθέται</span>) or ‘legislators’ was selected to review and revise the laws.</div>

<div class="p">When inscribed on stone for the permanent record, decrees begin with the formula, <span class="quote_inline">it was decided by the People,</span> or, <span class="quote_inline">It was decided by the Council and the People</span> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 206 4-5</span>, <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 206 28-30</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 237.5</span>, <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 237 31</span>); a law began with the formula, <span class="quote_inline">It was decided by the Nomothetae</span> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">SEG</span> 12 87.607</span>).</div>

<p>So, the Council was not responsible for actually making laws, but it was responsible for initating the process by which laws were made. At the first meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> for the year, in the month of Hekatombaion, the Athenians held votes on the whole body of laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span> where the month of Hekatombaion, or <span class="foreign">῾Εκατομαίων</span> is specified). This is how Demosthenes describes the process, which begins with and annual review of the existing laws:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>In the first presidency and on the eleventh day thereof, in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, the Herald having read prayers, a vote shall be taken on the laws, to wit, first upon laws respecting the Council, and secondly upon general statutes, and then upon statutes enacted for the nine <span class="term">Archons</span>, and then upon laws affecting other authorities. Those who are content with the laws respecting the Council shall hold up their hands first, and then those who are not content; and in like manner in respect of general statutes. All voting upon laws shall be in accordance with laws already in force</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Demosthenes continues his description of the annual review: <blockquote class="quote"><p>If any law already in force be rejected on show of hands, the Prytaneis of the Council (<span class="foreign">τοὺς πρυτάνεις</span>) in whose term of office the voting takes place shall appoint the last of the three meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> for the consideration of laws so rejected. The Proedroi (<span class="foreign">τοὺς προέδρους</span>) who preside by lot at the <span class="term">Assembly</span> are required, immediately after religious observances, to put the question respecting the sessions of the Nomothetae (<span class="foreign">τῶν νομοθετῶν</span>), and respecting the fund from which their fees are to be paid. The Nomothetae shall consist of persons who have taken the judicial oath</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>). The ‘judicial oath’ was the oath that jurors swore before entering a courtroom (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>; a passage in Demosthenes, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.149-151</span>, purports to be the text of that oath).</div>

<div class="p">The Prytaneis of the Council were charged with creating a Preliminary Decree that would allow the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to begin the review of the laws. There were severe penalties for Councilors who failed to fulfill this duty: <blockquote class="quote"><p>If the Prytaneis do not convene the <span class="term">Assembly</span> according to the written regulations, or if the Proedroi do not put the question, each Prytanis shall forfeit one thousand drachmas of sacred money to Athene, and each Proedros shall forfeit forty drachmas of sacred money to Athene</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.22</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The Council’s role was not complete, however, with the selection of legislators. <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span> contains a decree that orders <span class="quote_inline">the Council to cooperate in the legislative process</span> (<span class="foreign">συννομοθετεῖν δὲ καὶ τὴν βουλήν</span>) in the matter of convening the Nomothetae, which may mean only that the Council was to ensure that the business appeared on the agenda for the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The Council did, however, also have a special ‘legislative secretary’ (<span class="foreign">γραμματεύς ἐπὶ τοὺς νόμους</span>), who made copies of all laws, and attended all meetings of the Council; this suggests that the Council discussed proposals for legislation before sending them on to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 54.4</span>; <span class="bibl">Agora 15.62.235-236</span>).</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Jurisdiction"><h2><span class="headingNumber">19. </span><span class="head">Jurisdiction</span></h2>


<p>According to Aristotle, in the early history of the Athenian Democracy, the Council had the power to impose fines, imprison people, and even order them executed; but, Aristotle goes on to say, after the Council had condemned a certain Lysimachus to death, the Athenians saved his life, and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> decreed that only a <span class="term">law-court</span> would have the power to execute (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.1</span>). While in the <span class="date">4th century</span> it seems clear that the Council did not have complete power of life-and-death over Athenians, there is no particularly good evidence that it ever did. So, either Aristotle knew of some evidence that no longer survives, or his description of the early powers of the Council is inaccurate.</p>

<p>A law survives from the beginning of the <span class="date">4th century</span> that lists limits to the Council’s authority (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 105</span>): in matters of war and peace, death sentences, large fines, disenfranchisement (that is, loss of <span class="term">citizenship</span>), the administration of public finances, and foreign policy, the Council could not act without the approval of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (although the surviving fragments of the law are not clear regarding these last two).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Council did play an important role in maintaining the health of the democracy, apart from its management of the agendas for meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. Its job was to watch over the more important public officials of Athens, to ensure that they were fit for their office and that they conducted their duties properly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.2</span>).</p>

<p>The main process by which the Council watched over the officials of the Athenian democracy was ‘Scrutiny’, or <span class="foreign">δοκιμασία</span> (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 59.4</span> for use of the noun). Aristotle describes the Scrutiny of the Nine <span class="term">Archons</span> (the six ‘Lawgivers’, or <span class="foreign">θεσμοθέται</span>, plus ‘The Archon’, or <span class="foreign">ἄρχων</span>, the ‘King Archon’, or <span class="foreign">ἄρχον βασιλεύς</span>, and the ‘Warlord’, or <span class="foreign">πολέμαρχος</span>), who were the most important officials of the democracy (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Arstot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.1-4</span>):</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>As to the officials designated the Nine <span class="term">Archons</span>, the mode of their appointment that was originally in force has been stated before; but now the six Lawgivers and their clerk are elected by lot, and also the Archon, King Archon and Warlord, from each tribe in turn. The qualifications of these are first checked in the Council of Five Hundred, except the Clerk, but he is checked only in a <span class="term">Jury-court</span>, as are the other officials (for all of them, both those elected by lot and those elected by show of hands, have their qualifications checked before they hold office), while the Nine Archons are checked in the Council and also again in a Jury-court. Formerly any official not passed by the Council did not hold office, but now there is an appeal to the Jury-court, and with this rests the final decision as to qualification. The questions put in examining qualifications are, first, <blockquote class="quote"><p>Who is your father and to what deme does he belong, and who is your father’s father, and who is your mother, and who is her father and what is his deme?</p></blockquote> Then whether he has a Family Apollo and Homestead Zeus, and where these shrines are; then whether he has family tombs and where they are; then whether he treats his parents well, and whether he pays his taxes, and whether he has done his military service. And after putting these questions the officer says, Call your witnesses to these statements. And when he has produced his witnesses, the officer further asks, <span class="quote_inline">Does anybody wish to bring a charge against this man?</span> And if any accuser is forthcoming, he is given a hearing and the man on trial an opportunity of defence, and then the official puts the question to a show of hands in the Council or to a vote by ballot in the <span class="term">Jury-court</span>; but if nobody wishes to bring a charge against him, he puts the vote at once; formerly one person used to throw in his ballot-pebble, but now all are compelled to vote one way or the other about them, in order that if anyone being a rascal has got rid of his accusers, it may rest with the jurymen to disqualify him.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.1-4</span>)</div>

<div class="p">This passage shows the role of the Council, and the limits of its authority. The Council conducted the Scrutiny of potential officials, but could not, by itself, deny them their office. If the Council disapproves a candidate, he had recourse to an appeal before a jury. This sentence needs some explanation: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Formerly one person used to throw in his ballot-pebble, but now all are compelled to vote one way or the other about them, in order that if anyone being a rascal has got rid of his accusers, it may rest with the jurymen to disqualify him</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.4</span>). Evidently, at one time, if a candidate came up for approval, and no one spoke out against him, the Council (or jury, as the case may have been), conducted a symbolic vote, a mere formality, with one person only placing one vote in favor. Later, according to Aristotle, this was changed to require a serious vote, with all members participating; this would ensure that people could vote against a candidate secretly, in case they were afraid to speak out openly.</div>

<p>Perhaps more important even than the Scrutiny of officials was the Council’s Scrutiny of Young Men, the <span class="foreign">δοκιμασία τῶν ἐφήβων</span>. Young men could become citizens when they turned eighteen, if they were the legitimate sons of two Athenian citizens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 42.1</span>). Young men would be inspected in their villages, initially, and added to the roles as new citizens if their fellow demesmen found that they met the requirements, but the final inspection of citizen-roles was the business of the Council, which conducted a Scrutiny of them to make sure that each was actually eighteen years old (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 42.2</span>). If the Councilors found that any candidates for <span class="term">citizenship</span> were too young, they would fine the members of the candidate’s deme who put him on the list (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 42.2</span>). After this Scrutiny, all these new candidates were sent off for two years of military training at the hands of selected instructors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 42.3-4</span>).</p>

<p>Similiarly, the Concil conducted a ‘Scrutiny of the Horses’, a <span class="foreign">δοκιμασία τῶν ἵππων</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 49.1</span>). Athenians who were to serve as cavalry in wartime were listed on a roll (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 49.1</span>), and the state paid them a salary and pay for their horses’ feed. If the Councilors found that a horse was not in good condition, or that it was improperly trained, they could fine its owner to recover the cost of its feed and deny him his cavalry pay (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 49.1-2</span>).</p>

<div class="p">The Council also conducted a ‘Scrutiny of the Helpless’, a <span class="foreign">δοκιμασία τῶν ἀδυνάτων</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 49.4</span>): <blockquote class="quote"><p>The Council also inspects the Helpless; for there is a law enacting that persons possessing less than 3 minae and incapacitated by bodily infirmity from doing any work are to be inspected by the Council, which is to give them a grant for food at the public expense at the rate of 2 obols a day each.</p></blockquote> This function of the Council is well-attested. The orator Lysias wrote a speech for a man defending his right to receive the pension due to the Helpless; the speech begins with an address, not to a jury (as so many speeches begin), but <span class="quote_inline">O Council</span> (<span class="foreign">ὦ βουλή</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 24.1</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The Council’s role in this ‘Scrutiny of the Helpless’ helps the orator Aeschines make an ironic point in his speech against Timarchus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1</span>). Among Timarchus’ many personal failings (the orator claims), he abandoned his own uncle to poverty. According to Aeschines, Arignotus was Aeschines’ uncle, an old blind man. Arignotus had always received financial support from his brother, Timarchus’ father, a wealthy man. But after the father died, and Timarchus came to control the estate, <blockquote class="quote"><p>he thrust aside this old and unfortunate man, his own uncle, and made way with the estate. He gave nothing to Arignotus for his support, but was content to see him, fallen from such wealth, now receiving the alms that the city gives to disabled paupers. Finally, and most shameful of all, when the old man’s name had been omitted at a revision of the list of pauper-pensioners, and he had laid a petition before the Council to have his dole restored, the defendant, who was a member of the Council, and one of the presiding officers that day (<span class="foreign">βουλευτὴς ὢν καὶ προεδρεύων</span>), did not deign to speak for him, but let him lose his monthly pension</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.103-104</span>).</div>

<p>Aeschines’ accusation against Timarchus certainly seems damning: Not only did Timarchus fail to perform his duty as the nephew to an old and infirm man, but he failed to perform his duty as a member of the Council by ensuring that one of the ‘Helpless’ citizens, the <span class="foreign">ἀδυνάτοι</span>, received support from the State.</p>

<div class="p">This orator’s case against Timarchus shows us another area of the Council’s jurisdiction. The Council could discipline its own members and expel them if they failed to act properly. According to Aeschines, Timarchus was accused of corruption during his year as a Councilor. <blockquote class="quote"><p>After this, when the Council had gone into the Council House, they expelled him with the test-vote, but they excused him with the real vote. And it pains me to tell you, though I must say it <span class="note" id="Note14"> [Aeschines tells his audience]</span>, that because the Council did not hand him over to the <span class="term">law-court</span>, nor did they expel him from the Council House, you did not give them their end-of-year bonus (<span class="foreign">δωρεᾶς</span>)</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.110-112</span>).</div>


<div class="p">So here, the Council deliberated expelling a member, but failed to do so, and if Aeschines can be believed, that failure cost them their bonus from the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. This passage offers one other interesting insight into the working of the Council. Aeschines says that the council, first, <span class="foreign">ἐξεφυλλοφόρησε μὲν αὐτόν</span>, <span class="quote_inline">voted him out with leaves,</span> but later, <span class="foreign">ἐν δὲ τῇ ψήφῳ κατεδέξατο</span>, <span class="quote_inline">excused him during the pebble-vote</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.112</span>). So, it seems, that the Councilors would take test votes using leaves for ballots, but would use pebbles for the official vote. (Demosthenes also mentions the Council voting with pebbles, that is, a secret ballot, rather than by show of hands when it was acting like a jury: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.42</span>). Note, too, that Aeschines’ account suggests that Timarchus would have had to go before a jury, if the Council had convicted him.</div>

<div class="p">In addition to conducting Scrutiny of officials as they enter office, and of future citizens as they reach their eighteenth year, the Council could hear accusations that someone should be removed from office, or have his <span class="term">citizenship</span> revoked. In a speech written by Lysias, the defendant has been accused of holding <span class="term">citizenship</span> under false pretenses. He addresses himself to <span class="quote_inline">Gentlemen of the Council,</span> <span class="foreign">ὦ ἄνδρες βουλευταί</span>, and notes that he has already <span class="quote_inline">been found, on Scrutiny, to be of legal age</span> (<span class="foreign">ἁνὴρ εἶναι ἐδοκιμάσθην</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.21</span>). Extra Scrutinies, beyond the regular ones, could be initiated at any time, either by a member of the Council calling for an investigation of an official (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Antiph. 6.49-50</span>), or by any Athenian citizen denouncing someone by means of an <span class="quote_inline">accusation to the Council</span> (<span class="foreign">εἰσαγγελία εἰς τὴν βουλήν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.63</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.42-44</span>). When someone brought such a charge to the Council, it would act like a jury-court, hearing arguments on both sides and voting with secret ballots (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.42-44</span>). In such cases, the Council’s decision was merely a preliminary verdict (<span class="foreign">κατάγνωσις</span>), and the accused person could appeal to a <span class="term">law-court</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.2</span>).</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Punishment"><h2><span class="headingNumber">20. </span><span class="head">Powers to Punish</span></h2>


<p>Under a few select circumstances the Council had the authority to punish Athenians, or at least to order them held in prison until a trial before a jury. For example, the Athenian democracy ‘out-sourced’ the collection of taxes to <span class="foreign">τελωνικοί</span>, or ‘tax-farmers’, men who paid for the right to collect taxes on behalf of the Athenians. Demosthenes suggests that the Council had special authority over these mean, and over others who owed money to the Athenian democracy:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>You have a law in operation, as good a law as ever was enacted, that holders of sacred or civil moneys shall pay the money in to the Council House, and that, failing such payment, the Council shall recover the money by enforcing the statutes applicable to tax-farmers;and on that law the administration of the treasury depends</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.95</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Demosthenes goes on to hint, at least, that it was in the power of the Council to imprison public debtors like the ones he mentioned above: <blockquote class="quote"><p>It follows that the whole business of the State must go to rack and ruin when, the payments on account of taxation being insufficient, there is a large deficiency, when that deficiency cannot be made up until towards the end of the year, and when, as regards the supplementary payments, neither the Council nor the law-courts have authority to imprison defaulters</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.98</span>). This passage does not come out and say that the Council could imprison public debtors, but thi ironic statement would certainly be more effective if that were the case.</div> 

<p>From earlier in the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>, a passage from the orator Andocides gives more firm evidence that the Council had the power to imprison public debtors. Andocides tells the story of a certain Cephisius thus:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Cephisius here purchased from the state the right to collect certain public rents, and obtained thereby a return of ninety minae from the farmers occupying the lands concerned. He then defaulted; and since he would have been placed in prison had he appeared in Athens, since it was laid down by law that any defaulting tax farmer may be so punished by the Council, he retired into exile</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.93</span>).</div>

<p>It seems, though, that while the Council could imprison public debtors, that imprisonment was not actually their punishment, but a way to keep them in town until they could be tried before a jury. Demosthenes quotes a law that makes this clear:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Law: Moved by Timocrates: if any Athenian citizens are now in jail or shall hereafter be imprisoned on impeachment by the Council, if the judgement against such prisoners be not delivered to the Judges by the Secretary of the Presidency in pursuance of the law of impeachment, be it enacted that the Eleven shall bring them before the Court within thirty days of the day on which they receive them into custody, unless prevented by public business, and, if so prevented, as soon as possible. Any Athenian qualified as a prosecutor may prosecute. If the culprit be convicted, the <span class="term">Court of Heliaea</span> shall assess such penalty, pecuniary or otherwise, as he appears to deserve. If the penalty assessed be pecuniary, he shall be imprisoned until he has paid the full amount of the fine inflicted</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.63</span>).</div>

<p>This law, if it is authentic (and it is important to remember that the laws quoted in Athenian orations are not always authentic), begins by assuming that some citizens have been imprisoned by the Council, and that some might be in the future. It goes on to limit the term of their imprisonment by setting time-limits for their trial before a jury. Their final punishment is up to the court of the Heliaea.</p>

<p>Such a law would be in keeping with the nature of the Council of the 500 under the Athenian democracy. This institution was very powerful, and so was potentially dangerous. In this matter, as in others that we have seen, the Athenians seem to have been very careful to limit the Council’s power.</p>

<p>Further evidence of both the Council’s authority to imprison people under certain circumstances, and the careful limits that the Athenians placed on the Council’s power, comes from Demosthenes’ speech against Timocrates. In this speech, we can see that the Council had the authority to imprison people accused of treason against Athens. Demosthenes begins by quoting from the legal language of the Athenian democracy, without (at first) stating clearly what he is quoting:</p>

<div class="p">Demosthenes quotes, <blockquote class="quote"><p>Nor will I imprison any Athenian citizen who offers three sureties taxed in the same class as himself, except any person found guilty of conspiring to betray the city or to subvert popular government, or any tax-farmer or his surety or collector being in default</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.144</span>).</div>

<p>So that is the fragment of legal language. But where does it come from? Demosthenes keeps his audience in suspence for a few more sentences, pausing to explain what it means:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>This statute, gentlemen of the Jury, is not intended for the protection of people who have stood their trial and argued their case, but for those who are still untried and its purpose is that they shall not plead at a disadvantage, or even without any preparation at all, because they have been sent to jail</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.145</span>).</div>

<p>So the rule that Demosthenes quoted is merely intended to allow citizens who have been accused, but not tried, to get out on bail, as it were. Finally, Demosthenes tells his audience where this phrase comes from, and why it is important:</p>

<div class="p">Demosthenes says that, <blockquote class="quote"><p>the formula, <span class="quote_inline">I will not imprison any Athenian citizen,</span> is not in itself a statute; it is merely a phrase in the written oath taken by the Council, to prevent politicians who are in the Council from caballing to commit any citizen to prison. Solon therefore, wishing to deprive the Council of authority to imprison, included this formula in the Councilors’ oath; but he did not include it in the judicial oath. He thought it right that a <span class="term">Court</span> of Justice should have unlimited authority, and that the convicted criminal should submit to any punishment ordered by the court</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.146</span>).</div>

<p>So, according to this orator at least, Solon himself, in the <span class="date">6th century BCE</span>, wrote this oath to limit the authority of the Council of 500; the Council could not hold people without bail, since only a (more democratic) <span class="term">jury-court</span> should have that kind of power.</p>

<div class="p">For our understanding of the Council’s authority, however, it is significant that this fragment of the Councilor’s Oath contains one exception: the Councilors swear not to imprison anyone without setting bail, <span class="quote_inline">except any person found guilty of conspiring to betray the city or to subvert popular government</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.144</span>). So accused traitors could be held in confinment, by order of the Council, until their trial.</div>

<p>Finally, could the Council, on its own authority, put people to death without a trial? Two pieces of evidence suggest so, but they need to be read and considered carefully.</p>

<div class="p">The first is from a speech written by Isocrates; the speaker is a man who is suing a banker, Pasion, claiming that the banker defrauded him of all his money. At one point in the speech, the speaker claims that he had invested in a trading expedition, but that someone had made the accusation that the cargo of the ship was illegal merchandise. He says, <blockquote class="quote"><p>When I disputed this claim and demanded that the ship put to sea, those who make a business of blackmail so influenced the Council that at first I almost was put to death without a trial; finally, however, they were persuaded to allow someone to post bail for me</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 17.42</span>).</div>

<p>This is the kind of evidence that makes the business of ancient history difficult. The speech, written by a resident of <span class="date">4th century</span> Athens, delivered by a resident of Athens to an Athenian jury, says very clearly that he, the defendant, was in danger of having the Council put him to death without a trial. But was the speaker <em>really</em> in such danger, or is this merely a rhetorical device to build sympathy for himself? We should note that he was <em>not</em> in fact, put to death, but posted bail and was released. (Perhaps we can conclude that having something to do with a contraband cargo put this man in the same category as the public debtors, and so the Council had the authority to hold him until we was tried by a jury, unless he posted bail.)</p>

<p>And along with the problem of the speaker’s sincerity, there is the problem of consistency: given the many checks on the authority of the Council, does it seem likely that it would have the power to execute someone, without trial, on the matter of a ship’s cargo?</p>

<p>Different conclusions are possible, but most students of Athenian democracy would probably take the nature of the specific evidence (an offhand, rhetorical comment about what ‘almost happened’) and the majority of other evidence (which suggests that the Council’s authority to take final action, without the more democratic institutions of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> or the <span class="term">lawcourts</span>) and decide not to jump to any conclusions.</p>

<div class="p">One other piece of evidence is more direct. Aristotle describes how, after the Tyranny of the <span class="term">Thirty</span> had come to an end in the winter of <span class="date">403-402 BCE</span>, the Athenians went about restoring their democracy and trying to bring an end to the (inevitable) bitterness that threatened to divide the population. (The historical development of the Council, including its role in these events, is discussed in another <span class="term">article</span>; for the Tyranny of the Thirty generally, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.3-4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 14.3-6</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 14.32-33</span>; source for this date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). During this critical time, Aristotle says, a certain Archinus acted skillfully to bring the population of Athens back together; for example, he discouraged many of those who had supported the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span> from emigrating from the city, keeping them in Athens until they saw that they were not to be persecuted (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 40.1</span>). Aristotle continues, <blockquote class="quote"><p>This seems to have been a statesmanlike act of Archinus; as was also later his indicting as unconstitutional the decree of Thrasybulus admitting to <span class="term">citizenship</span> all those who had come back together from Piraeus, some of whom were clearly slaves, and his third act of statesmanship was that when somebody began to stir up grudges against the returned citizens, he arraigned him before the Council and persuaded it to execute him without trial, saying that this was the moment for them to show if they wished to save the democracy and keep their oaths; for by letting this man off they would incite the others too, but if they put him out of the way they would make him an example to everybody</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 40.2</span>).</div>

<p>So these were the acts of Archinus to preserve the Athenian people: he prevented mass emigration of a portion of the citizens; he prevented the wholesale enfranchisments, that is, the indiscriminate granting of <span class="term">citizenship</span> to anyone who had opposed the tyranny; and he persuaded the Council to execute, without trial, someone who was stirring up grudges against the supporters of the deposed <span class="term">Tyrants</span>. In short, Archinus’ policy seems to have been to do whatever he could to erase the divisions among the people that had arisen from the Tyranny. Citizens were citizens, and slaves were slaves, regardless of which side anyone had supported in previous days.</p>

<p>This is direct and positive evidence for the Council executing someone without trial. But, as with the evidence from Isocrates, this evidence requires careful consideration. Was execution-without-trial a normal privilege of the Council, or was it an extreme measure, technically illegal but (arguably) justified in this one extraordinary circumstance, when the city was trying to restore the rule of law after overthrowing a brutal tyranny? Again, the mass of evidence that we have, which shows how careful the Athenians limited the authority of the Council, would probably lead to the conclusion that, Aristotle’s account notwithstanding, the Council could not normally execute Athenian citizens without sending them to a democratic jury for a trial.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Administration"><h2><span class="headingNumber">21. </span><span class="head">Administration of Attica</span></h2>


<p>Because the Council represented the largest institution of the Athenian democracy that existed on a full-time basis, with groups of fifty Councilors serving for an ‘administrative month,’ or ‘prytany,’ at a time, it made sense for this body to play a large role in the administration of Athens. The Council was responsible for making the city work properly.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the Council was responsible for inspecting members of the cavalry and their horses (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 49.1-2</span>). The Council had additional responsibilities toward the military defenses of Attica as well. Demosthenes mentions a law that required the Council to oversee the building of new warships; the law specified that the Councilors would not get their end-of-year bonus (<span class="foreign">δωρειά</span>) if they failed in this duty (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 22.8</span>).</p>

<p>A decree of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> survives on an inscription that is very specific about the Council’s responsibility toward the outfitting of the naval fleet. The decree orders certain individual citizens to take charge of the outfitting and dispatch of the fleet—these citizens were called ‘Trierarchs’ (<span class="foreign">τριήραρχος</span>)—but goes on to make the Council responsible for seeing that the job gets done (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 1629.233-266</span>; much of this is echoed at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 46.1</span>):</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Should anyone, whether he be an official or a private citizen, not do any of the things he has been assigned by this Decree, let him owe ten thousand drachmas to the Treasury of Athene, and let the Auditor and the Assessor mark down this obligation, or owe the fine themselves. And it is necessary for the Council to punish those of the Trierarchs who were responsible for the fleet but who shirked their duty. And the Prytaneis must make a session of the Council concerning the fleet, and it should meet continuously until the fleet is ready. And the People will choose ten men out of all the Athenians to be Naval Constructors, to take responsibility for the fleet, according to the instructions of the Council. And if the Council and the Prytaneis are responsible for the fleet, they will be crowned by the People from the <span class="note" id="Note15"> [some text missing]</span> drachmas. And if this Decree has left anything out concerning the fleet, the Council has the authority to make other decrees, as long as it does not undo any of the Decrees of the People.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 1629.233-266</span>)</div>

<p><span class="foreign">ἐὰν δέ τις μὴ ποήσει, οἷς ἕκαστα προστέτακται, ἢ ἄρχων ἢ ἰδιώτης, κατὰ τόδε τὸ ψήφισμα, ὀφειλέτω ὁ μὴ ποήσας μυρίας δραχμὰς ἱερὰς τῆι Ἀθηνᾶι, καὶ ὁ εὔθυνος καὶ οἱ πάρεδροι ἐπάναγκες αὐτῶν καταγιγνωσκόντων ἢ αὐτοὶ ὀφειλόντων. τὴν δὲ βουλὴν τοὺς ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τοῦ ἀποστόλου κολάζουσαν τοὺς ἀτακτοῦντας τῶν τριηράρχων κατὰ τοὺς νόμους· τοὺς δὲ πρυτάνεις ποεῖν βουλῆς ἕδραν ἐπὶ χώματι περὶ τοῦ ἀποστόλου συνεχῶς, ἕως ἂν ὁ ἀπόστολος γένηται. ἑλέσθαι δὲ καὶ ἀποστολέας τὸν δῆμον δέκα ἄνδρας ἐξ Ἀθηναίων ἁπάντων, τοὺς δὲ αἱρεθέντας ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τοῦ ἀποστόλο, καθάπερ τῆι βουλεῖ προστέτακται. εἶναι δὲ τῆι βουλεῖ καὶ τοῖς πρυτάνεσιν ἐπιμεληθεῖσιν τοῦ ἀποστόλου στεφανωθῆναι ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου χρυσῶι στεφάνωι ἀπὸ ?Ελλιπσις??δραχμῶν. ἐὰν δέ τοῦ προσδέει τόδε τὸ ψήφισμα τῶν περὶ τὸν ἀπόστολον, τὴν βουλὴν κυρίαν εἶναι ψηφίζεσθαι μὴ λύουσαν μηθὲν τῶν ἐψηφισμένων τῶι δήμωι.</span> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 1629.233-266</span>)</p>

<p>This law not only shows the Council’s authority over the construction and dispatch of Athens’ navy, but also illustrates, again, the separation of powers under the Athenian Democracy: the <span class="term">Assembly</span> here delegates authority to the Council, but in the end it is the <span class="term">Assembly</span> of the People that have the final word.</p>

<div class="p">The Council was also responsible for keeping the harbor and naval yards in good repair (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 46.1</span>), and indeed for all of the defenses of the Piraeus (the harbor), the Long Walls (that connected the harbor to the city), and <span class="quote_inline">all the rest of the stone walls</span> (<span class="foreign">τὰ ἔλλοιπα τῶν λιθίνων τειχῶν</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 244.36-37</span>).</div>

<p>Beyond the administration of military matters, the Council had to inspect all public buildings (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 49.3</span>), and it controlled the religious sanctuaries in the city of Athens and the whole territory of Attica (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 244</span>).</p>

<div class="p">In short, as Aristotle says, <span class="quote_inline">The Council shares in, if I may say so, the administration of the greatest number of the duties</span> (<span class="foreign">συνδιοικεῖ δὲ καὶ ταῖς ἄλλαις ἀρχαῖς τὰ πλεῖσθ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 49.3</span>).</div>

</div>



<div class="Section" id="Finance"><h2><span class="headingNumber">22. </span><span class="head">Public Finance</span></h2>


<p>The Council was fully involved in almost every aspect of public finance under the Athenian democracy, from overseeing the collection of money, to managing its distribution where needed, to punishing those who failed to pay to the city what they owed or who misspent what they received from the city. Because the subject of public finance is so complicated, it deserves its own treatment as an aspect of Athenian Democracy, but in this discussion of the Council generally, it will be enough to suggest, through the primary sources, how the Council financed its own activities.</p>

<p>A writer in the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span> wrote a tract about the Athenian democracy. This text was originally attributed to the writer Xenophon, but since scholars no longer think that Xenophon actually wrote it, the author is called ‘Pseudo-Xenophon,’ or the ‘False Xenophon’—because the tract is quite critical of the democracy at Athens, this author is sometimes called the ‘Old Oligarch.’ One of the points of criticism he raises is the perceived inefficiency of the Athenian government, how long it can take for the Council or the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to get around to hearing about any new business:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>I notice also that objections are raised against the Athenians because it is sometimes not possible for a person, though he sit about for a year, to negotiate with the Council or the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. This happens at Athens for no other reason than that—owing to the quantity of business—they are not able to deal with all persons before sending them away. For how could they do this? First of all they have to hold more festivals than any other Greek city (and when these are going on it is even less possible for any of the city’s affairs to be transacted), next they have to preside over private and public trials and investigations into the conduct of magistrates to a degree beyond that of all other men, and the Council has to consider many issues involving war, revenues, law-making, local problems as they occur, also many issues on behalf of the allies, receipt of tribute, the care of dockyards and shrines. Is there accordingly any cause for surprise if with so much business they are unable to negotiate with all persons?</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Ps. Xen. <span class="titlem">Const. Ath.</span> 3.1-2</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Pseudo-Xenophon’s condensed list of the Council’s duties—<blockquote class="quote"><p>war, revenues, law-making, local problems as they occur, also many issues on behalf of the allies, receipt of tribute, the care of dockyards and shrines</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Ps. Xen. <span class="titlem">Const. Ath.</span> 3.2</span>)—can suggest how and why the Council was, inevitably, deeply involved in matters of public finance, both the acquiring and the spending of public money.</div>

<div class="p">Under normal circumstances, the Council had its own money, a share of the public money, that was apportioned for the Council’s use by the Treasurers (<span class="foreign">οἱ ταμίαι</span>). So, for example, if the Council needed to arrange for a public stele, a stone with a decree inscribed on it, they could use their own budget to pay the inscriber, as this preserved decree shows: <blockquote class="quote"><p>[The Council and the People decreed that] the Treasurers of the Council give 30 talants to the inscriber of this stele, from the funds apportioned to the Council</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ἐς δὲ τὴν ἀναγραφὴν τῆς στήλης δοῦναι τοὺς ταμίας τῆς βουλῆς 30 δραχμὰς ἐκ τῶν κατὰ ψηφίσματα ἀναλισκομένων τῆι βουλῆι</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 120.20-22</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Another example is this decree, preserved on an inscription, in which the Council has voted to honor a certain Eudodoxos with a gold crown, costing 500 drachmas. The inscription specifies that, <span class="quote_inline">the Treasurers will give the silver [for the crown] from the money apportioned, according to the decrees, for the Council</span> (<span class="foreign">τοὺς δὲ ταμίας δοῦναι τὸ ἀργύριον ἐκ τῶν κατὰ ψηφίσματα ἀναλισκομένων τῆι βουλῆι</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 223</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Funds were not always sufficient, and this could lead to trouble. The orator Lysias says, in one of his speeches, that <blockquote class="quote"><p>the Council, whenever it deliberates, as long as it has enough money for its administration, never goes wrong; but whenever it gets into financial difficulties, it is forced to accept <span class="term">impeachments</span>, to confiscate the property of citizens, and to be persuaded by the arguments of the worst sort of orator</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ἡ βουλὴ ἡ ἀεὶ βουλεύουσα, ὅταν μὲν ἔχῃ ἱκανὰ χρήματα εἰς διοίκησιν, οὐδὲν ἐξαμαρτάνει, ὅταν δὲ εἰς ἀπορίαν καταστῇ, ἀναγκάζεται εἰσαγγελίας δέχεσθαι καὶ δημεύειν τὰ τῶν πολιτῶν καὶ τῶν ῥητόρων τοῖς τὰ πονηρότατα λέγουσι πείθεσθαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.22</span>).</div>

<p>Since the Council had so much power and handled so much money, the Athenians were careful to ensure that it dealt honestly and openly. Aristotle describes the elaborate system of public accounting and accountability that accompanied the Council’s job of receiving and distributing funds.</p>

<p>For example, when an Athenian citizen held a lease on some public land, he made his payments to the Council once a year, in the ninth prytany (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 47.4</span>). The actual money was not collected by the Councilors, however, but by the ten ‘Sellers’ (<span class="foreign">οἱ πωληταί</span>), who were randomly chosen by lot (<span class="foreign">κληροῦται</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 47.2</span>). These received the money and recorded the payment on tablets (<span class="foreign">καταβολαί</span>), which were brought to the Council by the Secretary (<span class="foreign">γραμματεύς</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 47.5</span>). In the Council House, the Secretary handed the tablets over to the ten Receivers (<span class="foreign">ἀποδέκται</span>), who were also chosen by lot (<span class="foreign">κεκληρωμένοι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.1</span>). These Receivers reviewed the receipts for payments in the presence of the Council, and recorded the names of everyone who had paid on their leases, and the amount they paid; then they gave the receipts back to the Secretary (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.1</span>). The Receivers then decide how to distribute (<span class="foreign">μερίζουσι</span>) the collected funds to the various officials, including (presumably) the Council itself. They write out this budget (<span class="foreign">μερισμός</span>, literally ‘distribution’) on another tablet; once they have read out the budget publically, the Council could debate its merits (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.2</span>). According to Aristotle, the specific concern in this debate was that some official or private citizen might have tried to influence the budget for his own advantage (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.2</span>), but it seems reasonable that other issues would be topics of debate as well, such as how much money each arm of the government should receive.</p>

<p>After the funds were apportioned, the Council appointed two groups of auditors to ensure that no one misused funds. One group was the ten Auditors (<span class="foreign">λογισταί</span>), whom the Council chose by lot (<span class="foreign">κληροῦσι</span>) from their own members (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.4</span>). The other group was the ten Examiners (<span class="foreign">εὔθυνοι</span>), whom the Council chose by lot (<span class="foreign">κληροῦσι</span>) from the population as a whole (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.4</span>). The Auditors checked the records of each official at the end of each prytany (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.4</span>). The Examiners sat in public, by the Statues of the Eponymous Heroes, and any citizen could come to them and lodge a complaint about how any official had handled public funds (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.4</span>). If an Examiner received a complaint, the matter did not go to the Council, but to the Thesmothetae, the <span class="term">Archons</span>, who would hand the matter over to a jury (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 48.5</span>).</p>

<p>So while the Council was at the center of the business of receiving and disbursing public money, the process was carefully designed to prevent corruption. The Councilors did not actually receive the money, nor did they actually keep the accounts, nor did they actually draw up the budget. They witnessed that process, approved the budget, and selected auditors. Even in the selection of auditors, the Council’s power was limited. Selection was by random lot, and in addition to the auditors chosen from among the members of the Council, there was an additional body of Examiners who were not Councilors. If this latter group found evidence of corruption, they did not report to the Council but to the <span class="term">Archons</span> and the <span class="term">jury-courts</span>.</p>

<p>Even though there were 500 Councilors each year, the Athenians treated this institution carefully. It was not as democratic as the <span class="term">Assembly</span> or the <span class="term">Lawcourts</span>, and while it was a necessary part of the government of the city, the Athenians were careful to keep its business open to scruty and its power in check.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="ForeignPolicy"><h2><span class="headingNumber">23. </span><span class="head">Foreign Policy</span></h2>


<p>The most momentous decisions of Athenian foreign policy, matters of war and peace, were ultimately in the hands of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. Nevertheless, the Council, the institution of government that was ‘open’ day and night, all year ’round, played an important role in how Athens interacted with the rest of the world. The Council often represented the People of Athens in an official capacity, receiving ambassadors from foreign states, selecting Athenians to represent the city abroad, and taking advantage of its ability to discuss matters in confidence, apart from non-Athenian ears.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could not even debate a matter unless the Council had put it on the agenda by passing a probouleuma, or Preliminary Decree; this fact alone gave the Council a certain authority over matters of foreign policy. Aeschines notes this at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.60-61</span>, when he accuses Demosthenes of manipulating the Council in such a way that the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was forced to discuss a matter of foreign policy <em>before</em> some Athenian ambassadors had returned from a mission.</p>

<p>The division of authority could go both ways, however. While the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could not act without a Preliminary Decree from the Council, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could also empower the Council to take over business for which the <span class="term">Assembly</span> itself was not well suited. An inscription bearing a decree of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> on the matter of the Athenian navy demonstates this; the <span class="term">Assembly</span> set the outfitting of the fleet in motion, but it was up to the Council to see the business through. The Athenian navy, of course, was the most active and palpable instrument of Athenian foreign policy:</p>

<div class="p"><span class="quote_inline">If anything is lacking from the present decree regarding the fleet,</span> the Decree of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> says, <span class="quote_inline">the Council is authorized to make new resolutions, as long as it does not undo any of the decrees of the People</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐὰν δέ τοῦ προσδέει τόδε τὸ ψήφισμα τῶν περὶ τὸν ἀπόστολον, τὴν βουλὴν κυρίαν εἶναι ψηφίζεσθαι μὴ λύουσαν μηθὲν τῶν ἐψηφισμένων τῶι δήμωι</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 1629.264-269</span>).</div>

<div class="p">We can see the Council acting as the institution that represents Athens officially in a decree, preserved on an inscription, having to do with a treaty between the Athenian people and Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse in Sicily. Here, it seems that the Council, along with the Generals, Cavarly Commanders, and Commanders of Archers were to swear oaths committing Athens to a treaty of mutual military suppoer (<span class="foreign">ἡ συμμαχία</span>): <blockquote class="quote"><p>It is decreed that the ambassadors who have come from Dionysius will carry the oath concerning the treaty of mutual military assistance, and it will be sworn by the Council, the Generals, the Cavalry Commanders, and the Commanders of Archers</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">λαβεῖν δὲ τὸν ὅρκον τὸμ περὶ τῆς συμμαχίας τοὺς πρέσβεις τοὺς παρὰ Διονυσίου ἥκοντας, ὀμόσαι δὲ τήν τε βουλὴν καὶ τὸς στρατηγοὺς καὶ τοὺς ἱππάρχους καὶ τοὺς ταξιάρχος</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 105.32-34 = Tod 136</span>).</div>

<div class="p">We have already seen that the ‘Prytaneis’ where the fifty Councilors who served, on a day-in and day-out basis, for one-tenth of the Athenian year. It was to these men that messengers from abroad and envoys from foreign states came first, bearing news to the Athenians. Demosthenes describes a dramatic moment when messengers from the north of Greece came to Athens bearing news that Philip of Macedon had captured Elatea; the messengers came directly to the Prytaneis of the Council: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Evening had already fallen when a messenger arrived bringing to the Prytaneis the news that Elatea had been taken. They were sitting at supper, but they instantly rose from table, cleared the booths in the marketplace of their occupants, and unfolded the hurdles, while others summoned the commanders and ordered the attendance of the trumpeter. The commotion spread through the whole city. At daybreak on the morrow the presidents summoned the Council to the Council House, and the citizens flocked to the place of assembly. Before the Council could introduce the business and prepare the agenda, the whole body of citizens had taken their places on the hill.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.169</span>). This passage shows clearly <em>why</em> it was appropriate for the Council to receive foreign visitors: any action in response to news from abroad, even if that action were the responsibility of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, would require the Council to, first, call an assembly, and second, put the matter at hand on the agenda of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> by means of a Prelimary Decree.</div>

<div class="p">Aeschines says that it was usual for the Council to allow foreign ambassadors to address the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.58</span>). The Council could also award visitors certain benefits, such as a meal at public expense (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.235</span>), or special seats in the Theater (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.55</span>). But the Council could also treat ambassadors more curtly. Xenophon describes how, after the battle of Leuctra, the Thebans sent messengers to ask Athens for an alliance against the Spartans: <blockquote class="quote"><p>As for the Thebans, immediately after the battle they sent to Athens a garlanded messenger, and while telling of the greatness of their victory, they at the same time urged the Athenians to come to their aid, saying that now it was possible to take vengeance upon the Lacedaemonians for all the harm they had done to them. Now the Council of the Athenians chanced to be holding its meeting on the Acropolis. And when they heard what had taken place, it was made clear to everyone that they were greatly distressed; for they did not invite the herald to partake of hospitality and about the matter of aid they gave him no answer. So the herald departed from Athens without having received a reply.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 6.4.20</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Athenian ambassadors, too, when returning from a mission abroad, came to report first to the Council, before going to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. Aeschines describes one such scene, when Demosthenes, serving as Councilor, moved that the Council award the ambassadors (including Aeschines himself) a crown and invite them to a meal at public expense: <blockquote class="quote"><p>On our return, then, after we had rendered to the Council a brief report of our mission and had delivered the letter from Philip, Demosthenes praised us to his colleagues in the Council, and he swore by Hestia, goddess of the Council, that he congratulated the city on having sent such men on the embassy, men who in honesty and eloquence were worthy of the state. In referring to me he said something like this: that I had not disappointed the hopes of those who elected me to the embassy. And to cap it all he moved that each of us be crowned with a garland of wild olive because of our loyalty to the People, and that we be invited to dine on the morrow in the Prytaneum.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.45-46</span>)</div>

<div class="p">While the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was responsible for selecting Athenians to serve as ambassadors to other states, it could delegate that authority to the Council. One decree, passed by both the Council and the <span class="term">People</span> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 117</span>; it begins <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the Council and the People…,</span> <span class="foreign">ἔδοξεν τῆι βουλῆι καὶ τῶι δήμωι</span>) contains the following provision: <blockquote class="quote"><p>[it is decreed] for the Council to select, at once, ten men as ambassadors, five from the Council and five from among the private citizens, who will receive the oaths from the people of Eretria</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ἑλέσθαι δὲ πρέσβες αὐτίκα μάλα τὴν βουλὴν δέκα ἄνδρας, πέντε μὲν ἐκ τῆς βουλῆς, πέντε δὲ ἐξ ἰδιωτῶν, οἵτινες ἀπολήψονται τοὺς ὅρκους παρὰ Ἐρετριέων</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 117.19-21</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Foreign policy often requires planning and acting in secret, and for this reason the Council was better suited than the <span class="term">Assembly</span> for discussing sensitive issues. Unlike the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, whose proceedings took place out of doors, for all to hear, the Council could meet privately. Demosthenes says, <blockquote class="quote"><p>The Council of the Five Hundred, thanks to this barrier <span class="note" id="Note16"> [the wooden fence that prevented anyone from trespassing on the procedings]</span>, frail as it is, is master of its own secrets, and no private citizen can enter it</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">τὸ τὴν βουλὴν τοὺς πεντακοσίους ἀπὸ τῆς [ἀσθενοῦς] τοιαυτησὶ κιγκλίδος τῶν ἀπορρήτων κυρίαν εἶναι, καὶ μὴ τοὺς ἰδιώτας ἐπεισιέναι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 25.23</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Aeschines at one point accuses Demosthenes of taking advantage of the Council’s ability to exclude private citizens from its meetings: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Now when we had reported this decree to our Council, and then to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and when the people had approved our acts, and the whole city was ready to choose the righteous course, and when Demosthenes had spoken in opposition—he was earning his retaining-fee from Amphissa—and when I had clearly convicted him in your presence, thereupon the fellow, unable to frustrate the city by open means, goes into the senate chamber, expels all listeners, and from the secret session brings out a bill to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, taking advantage of the inexperience of the man who made the motion</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.125-127</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Aeschines’ accusations aside, there were clearly times when the Council needed to act secretly, such as when the Athenians were laying plans to oppose Alexander the Great: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Ultimately they chose as supreme commander the Athenian Leosthenes, who was a man of unusually brilliant mind, and thoroughly opposed to the cause of Alexander. He conferred secretly with the Council at Athens and was granted fifty talents to pay the troops and a stock of weapons sufficient to meet pressing needs</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 17.111.3</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Between the Council and the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, the Athenians had a system whereby the whole body of citizens had a say in how Athens interacted with the rest of the world, while still providing for around-the-clock responses to crises, formal and orderly reception of foreign dignitaries, and (most important) the ability to debate and decide matters secretly. Ironically, Athens’ attempt to oppose Macedonian power, which is the subject of the quotation from Diodorus above, let to the end of the city’s independance as a free democracy. Having happened upon the end of classical Athenian democracy, in this discussion of the Council, it is worthwhile to back up and look at how the institution developed from the earliest days until its most fully developed form in the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>. A discussion of that history and the sources for our knowledge of it appear in a separate Demos article (see <span class="quote_inline"><span class="term">Council: its history</span></span>).</div>
