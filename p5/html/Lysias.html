<div class="Description" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Lysias</span></h2>

<p>Born about <span class="date">458 BCE</span>, died in <span class="date">380 BCE</span> (source for dates: <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). He was the son of Cephalus, a shield-maker from Syracuse in Sicily, who was invited by Pericles to take up residence in Athens around <span class="date">470 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl">W.R.M. Lamb, <span class="titlem">Lysias</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1943] ix</span>). Shortly after his father’s death, Lysias moved with his older brother Polemarchus to Thurii, an Athenian colony in southern Italy. After the failure of the Athenian expedition against Sicily (<span class="date">413 BCE</span>), Lysias and Polemarchus were expelled from the colony at which time they returned to Athens to take up residence. In <span class="date">403 BCE</span> (source for dates: <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>), both Lysias and Polemarchus were arrested by the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>. Lysias escaped to Megara; Polemarchus, however, was executed. Later, after the overthrow of the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>, Lysias returned to Athens and was granted <span class="term">citizenship</span> on a motion moved by Thrasybulus. Due to a technical irregularity in the grant, Lysias’ <span class="term">citizenship</span> was soon overturned. He spent the remainder of his life writing speeches on behalf of litigants. A total of thirty-five works have survived which are attributed to Lysias. (See also the genre of Oratory.)</p>
