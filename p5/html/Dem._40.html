<p>(Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Against Boeotus II</span>; see also Oratory). This is a speech attributed to Demosthenes’s authorship, written for a man named Mantitheus, who was suing his half-brother Boeotus. This is the second time Mantitheus sued Boeotus (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 39</span>). The plaintiff was the legitimate son of Mantias, who had two other, illegitimate sons, the older one of whom was Boeotus, the defendant. After Mantias died, all three sons agreed to divide their father’s property three ways. But a dispute arose regarding their mothers' money: the defendant claimed that his mother had brought one talent (see <span class="term">Money</span>) into the marriage, which he did not want to share with his half-brothers. The half-brothers claimed that their mother had given Mantias (the father) 100 minae (see <span class="term">Money</span>), which they did not want to share with Mantitheus. In the speech, Mantitheus says that the case had been in arbitration for eleven years before coming to trial, and he further claims that the half-brothers might try to poison him. Based on the style of this speech, it is generally thought that this speech is not actually by Demosthenes (source: <span class="bibl">A.T. Murray, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes IV</span> [Cambridge, Loeb: 1936] 481</span>). The speech was written sometime after <span class="date">348 BCE</span>, which is the date for the first suit between this plaintiff and defendant (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 39</span>) (Source for date: <span class="bibl">R. Sealey, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes and his Time: a study in defeat</span> [Oxford, 1993] 144</span>) </p>
