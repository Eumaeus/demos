 lived in <span class="quote_inline">an extension of the Athenian state overseas</span> (Graham
 1983, 167ff.). Such a restoration would represent the earliest attestations
 of a cleruchy, dating to the period of or just after the Cleisthenic
 reforms. Other restorations suggest ‘Athenians,’ an
 individual Athenian, ‘hoplite soldiers’ or
 ‘inhabitants,’ the last side-stepping the issue of
 the dwellers’ legal status. Matthaiou’s publication of a

 The proposed restorations all focus on the same notion: that the cleruchs on
 Salamis were subjected to the same
 taxation and military levy as those residing in Athens. Financial and military obligations were common for
 cleruchs, although the land owned in a cleruchy was not part of a
 citizen’s land-holding assessment for liturgical obligations in
 Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 14.16</span>; M.H. Hansen,
 <span class="titlem">Demography and democracy : the number of Athenian citizens in the
 fourth century B.C.</span> [Herning, Denmark: Systime 1986], n.218). A
 4th century BCE inscription, <span class="titlem">IG</span> 2.2.30, also from the
 Athenian Acropolis, that deals with land ownership on Lemnos probably refers to the cleruchy on
 Salamis and may even cite the
 stipulations in <span class="titlem">IG</span> 1.3.1 as legal precedents for action taken
 in <span class="date">387/6</span> (Stroud,
 <span class="titlem">Hesperia</span> 40 [1971] 172-73). For line 2 here, I prefer

 latter is more likely, since the exactment of the former for leasing to a
 relative (l. 4, Wade-Gery) or dweller (Meritt) would be punitive.</p>

 <div class="section" id="commentary"><h2><span class="headingNumber">12. </span><span class="head">Historical Commentary</span></h2>
 
 <p>In the aftermath of the reforms of Cleisthenes of <span class="date">508/7
 BCE</span>, the new Athenian democracy sought to establish a presence in
 the Saronic Gulf against its
 Peloponnesian (led by Sparta) and Isthmian (led by Corinth)
 opponents. The nearby island of Aegina and
 the city-state of Corinth adjacent to the
 Isthmus both had spheres of interest in
 the Saronic Gulf. These and other
 <span class="foreign">
 poleis
 </span> were active members of the Peloponnesian League, which was led by
 Sparta and included Athens. The island of Salamis, which Athens had
 seized in the age of Pisistratus the
 tyrant <span class="date">ca. 560 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.3.3</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">9.6.2</span>), provided the ideal base for such a presence. This,
 the earliest decree of the Athenian <span class="foreign">
 dēmos
 </span>, addresses the rights and responsibilities of <span class="foreign">
 kleruchoi
 </span> or ‘cleruchs’ (Athenian citizens dwelling outside
 of Athens who retain their <span class="term">citizenship</span>) settled by Athens on the island: cleruchs must pay taxes and provide
 military services to Athens, they may lease
 the land only to kinsmen (the text here is fragmentary and may refer instead to
 a dweller) on penalty of a fine, and they must provide their own weapons. The
 text also refers to an Athenian <span class="term">archon</span>
 [here, the local governor, as at <span class="titlem">LSJ</span> s.v. <span class="foreign">a)/rxon</span>, II.2; cf. <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 54.7-8</span>]), whose responsibilities seem to focus on military assessment,
 and the boulē or <span class="term">Council</span> of 500
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.3.5</span>)
 recently created by Cleisthenes.</p>
 <p>Who are these settlers, and what does their relocation to Salamis
 <span class="date">ca. 510-500 BCE</span> tell us about the
 constitutional reforms of Cleisthenes? The
 inscription has long been recognized as the first extant Athenian decree and so
 has undergone considerable scrutiny. Although the various provisions that detail
 the fiscal and military obligations of those settled on the island have received
 attention in the scholarship, surely the most controversial passage lies at the
 end of line 1, and it is here that the identity of the settlers was articulated
 in this no-longer extant portion of the decree. The new fragment published by
 Matthaiou confirms the accusative plural <span class="foreign">-os</span>
 ending, but does not resolve whether the settlers were referred to as <span class="foreign">
 clerouchs
 </span> or as Athenian citizens.</p>
 <p><span class="foreign">
 Cleruchies
 </span> were a phenomenon mostly of <span class="date">5th</span> and <span class="date">4th century</span>
 Athens, and in simplest terms amounted to a
 community of Athenian colonists inhabiting territory outside of Attica with all of the rights and obligations of
 Athenian citizens (Graham 1983, 167ff.; the scholiast to <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Pindar 2.19</span> refers to Timodemos, of the Attic deme of Acharnai but a clerouch on Salamis). With the exception of the cleruchy at Chalcis in the aftermath of the conflict with
 Athens in 506 BCE (where Herodotus refers to the settlement of 4000
 Athenians on the land of well-to-do Chalcidians: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 5.77.2</span>, 6.100.1), and Salamis—if the restoration is
 correct—Athens dispatched no
 other cleruchs until the middle of the 5th century (for a list of the cleruchies
 ca. 450 BCE, see <span class="titlem">OCD</span> s.v. ‘cleruchy’). The
 restoration of <span class="foreign">klero/xos</span> supports the
 interpretation that an Athenian cleruchy on Salamis following on the heels of the Chalcidian settlement would serve as a none-too-subtle
 challenge to the authority of the Peloponnesian League in the Saronic Gulf
 (Taylor 1997, 13-15, who with Luria suggests a date as early as 510-508 BCE).
 These cleruchs on Salamis will have joined
 other resident non-native citizens who held deme membership back in Attica but lived on the island. Thus, Cleisthenes’ political
 reorganization of Athens and Attica may well have included efforts to create
 nearby pockets of Athenian <span class="term">citizens</span> who
 could promote Athens’ political
 agenda, even on the doorstep of her allies and rivals in the Saronic Gulf and Chalcis. </p>
