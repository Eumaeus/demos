<p>(Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Second Philippic</span>, see also Oratory). This is a speech that Demosthenes gave at a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and then published later. He delivered this speech sometime in <span class="date">344 BCE</span> or shortly afterwards (source for date: <span class="bibl">J.H. Vince, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes I</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 123</span>). In <span class="date">344 BCE</span>, Philip of Macedon had gotten involved in an ongoing conflict in the Peloponnese: Argos, Messene, and Arcadia, whose principle city was Megalopolis, were resisting Sparta, which had traditionally dominated the Peloponnese. Philip provided those cities with mercenaries and money. Athens, which was supportive of Sparta, sent an embassy to the Peloponnese to try to counteract Philip's influence. Demosthenes was a member of that embassy, which does not seem to have been successful. After the embassy had returned to Athens, envoys from Philip, Argos, and Messene came before the Athenian <span class="term">Assembly</span> to complain of Athenian interference. This speech is the published version of a speech that Demosthenes gave on that occasion, in which he complains of how some of his fellow Athenians have taken Philip's side and advocated a misguided policy. He proposes that Athens send a reply to Philip's complaints, but the details of that proposal are lost. (See also, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 4</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 9</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 10</span>â€”all speeches urging opposition to Philip, and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 16</span>, <span class="titlem">For the Megalopolitans</span>).</p>
