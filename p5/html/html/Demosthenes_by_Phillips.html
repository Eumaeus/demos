 Demosthenes
 This article was originally written for the online discussion series ‘Athenian
 Law in its Democratic Context,’ organized by Adriaan Lanni and sponsored by
 Harvard University’s Center for Hellenic
 Studies.Demosthenes son of Demosthenes of the deme Paeania (384-322) is generally regarded as the greatest of the Attic orators.
 At the age of seven he lost his father and was entrusted, along with his inheritance, to
 guardians. When he turned eighteen, however, he discovered that most of the money was
 gone; and so, after studying under Isaeus, Demosthenes took his guardians to court in 364. He delivered his first speeches (27-31) in these cases, and their success launched his career as a speechwriter.Demosthenes’ long and illustrious political
 career began in 355, when he composed speeches for the trials of
 Androtion (22) and Leptines (20). In the latter half of the 350s he continued to write forensic speeches for
 high-profile cases (24 ‘Against
 Timocrates’, 353; 23 ‘Against Aristocrates’,
 352), and also delivered his first speeches before the
 Athenian Assembly, including ‘On the Symmories’ (14) in
 354, ‘For
 the Megalopolitans’ (13) in 353, and ‘On the Liberty of the Rhodians’
 (15) in 351.Demosthenes rose to prominence as the foremost Athenian
 opponent of Philip II. In 351 he
 delivered his ‘First
 Philippic’ (4), in which he called for a more aggressive stance
 toward the rising threat of Macedon. In the three
 ‘Olynthiacs’ (1-3) of 348 he urged his countrymen to send aid to Olynthus, which was under Macedonian attack; but the auxiliary expeditions
 sent by Athens could not prevent Philip’s capture of the city. In 346
 Demosthenes took part in the embassies to Philip regarding the ‘Peace of Philocrates;’ on his return from the second embassy he accused
 several fellow ambassadors, including Aeschines, of
 taking bribes from Philip, and he attacked Philip for negotiating in bad faith. Despite his dissatisfaction, later in the
 year he delivered the speech ‘On the
 Peace’ (5), counseling the Athenians to abide by its terms.For the remainder of the decade Demosthenes continued
 to agitate against Philip at home and abroad, delivering the
 ‘Second Philippic’
 (6) in 344 and ‘On the Chersonese’ (8)
 and the ‘Third Philippic’
 (9) in 341. In 343
 Demosthenes brought Aeschines to trial and gave the oration ‘On the False Embassy’
 (19); Aeschines escaped a death sentence by a
 mere thirty votes. Demosthenes’ policy of
 resistance to Philip triumphed, but the resistance itself
 failed at the battle of Chaeroneia in 338. Nonetheless, Demosthenes
 remained influential at Athens. In 336
 Ctesiphon proposed that Demosthenes be awarded a gold crown for his public services; Aeschines brought an indictment against Ctesiphon for making an illegal
 proposal, but the case did not go to trial until 330.
 At Ctesiphon’s trial Demosthenes delivered his most famous oration, ‘On the Crown’ (18), and
 Aeschines was soundly defeated.Philip’s assassination in 336 led to an abortive attempt at revolt in which Demosthenes played a prominent role. For a while afterwards the Athenians
 acclimated themselves to Macedonian hegemony. In 324-323, however, Demosthenes was implicated
 in a scandal involving Harpalus, the fugitive treasurer of
 Alexander the Great. Accused of appropriating twenty talents
 of the funds Harpalus had brought to Athens, Demosthenes was convicted, fined,
 and imprisoned for failure to pay, but escaped and went into exile. Upon Alexander’s death in 323 he
 returned to Athens and again advised resistance to
 Macedon. After Antipater’s defeat of the Greek rebels in the ‘Lamian War,’
 Demosthenes, facing a death sentence, committed suicide
 by poison. (See also Oratory.)David D. PhillipsParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback David D. Phillips.
