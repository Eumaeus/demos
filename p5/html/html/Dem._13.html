<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>Dem. 13A TEI ProjectDem. 13Table of contents1. Dem. 131. Dem. 13 (Demosthenes, On Organization; see also Oratory). This speech was delivered before the Assembly at Athens, some time after 351 BCE (at Dem. 13.8 we learn that the speech was written after the democracy on the island of Rhodes was overthrown, which happened in 351. Source for date: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 352). Nowhere in the speech does the speaker say what, precisely, is the issue before the Assembly, and the speech argues several points about government, one after another, generally urging the citizens of Athens to take part in the city’s affairs and to avoid apathy, otherwise Athens will no longer be a leader among the Greek states. This speech is included in the body of Demosthenes’ Oratory, but it is entirely possible that he did not write it. Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W.
