Summary2. Poetry in the Courtroom3. Guarding Poetic Texts4. Poetry and the Tyrants5. Poetry &amp; the Dēmos1. SummaryThis article argues that poetry—the Homeric epics and the works of the
 tragedians—enjoyed an importance to the democratic government of
 Athens equal to that of the city’s laws. Like laws, poetry was
 powerful. Like the law, too, poetry was regulated and, at times, manipulated
 according to the political needs of the city and its rulers.2. Poetry in the Courtroom The pervasive civic importance of poetry in Athenian democracy during the
 fifth and fourth centuries BCE
 has been obvious since ancient times. The figure Demades in Plutarch calls the
 
 ‘theoric fund’
 , which paid for the entrance fee into dramatic festivals for all
 citizens, the glue of the democracy (ὡς
 ἔλεγε Δημάδης, κόλλαν ὀνομάζων τὰ θεωρικὰ τῆς
 δημοκρατίας) (Plut. Platonic Questions 1011b). In Aeschines’s oration Against
 Timarchus, Aeschines asks his jury
 to apply wisdom from the poetry of Euripides
 in their judgment of the case before them: Σκέψασθε δέ, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, τὰς γνῶμας ἃς
 ἀποφαίνεται ὁ ποιητής. Ἤδη δὲ πολλῶν πραγμάτων φησὶ
 γεγενῆσθαι κριτής, ὥσπερ νῦν ὑμεῖς δικασταί, καὶ τὰς κρίσεις
 οὐκ ἐκ τῶν μαρτυριῶν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκ τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων καὶ τῶν
 ὁμιλιῶν φησι ποιεῖσθαι... οὐκ ὤκνησεν ἀποφήνασθαι τοιοῦτον
 εἶναι οἷσπερ ἥδεται ξυνών. Οὐκοῦν δίκαιον καὶ περὶ
 Τιμάρχου τοῖς αὐτοῖς ὑμᾶς Εὐριπίδῃ χρήσασθαι
 λογισμοῖς.Consider, O Athenians, the sentiments that the poet expresses. He says that
 in the past he has been the arbiter of many disputes, just as you jurors are
 now, and he says that he makes his decisions not based on the testimony of
 witnesses, but on the habits and company of the defendant… he did
 not shrink from claiming that a man’s character is none other than
 that of those with whom he likes to associate. Therefore it is right for you
 also to use the same logic as Euripides in
 the case of Timarchus. (Aeschines, Against
 Timarchus 153)  In fact throughout his prosecution Aeschines
 provides carefully selected citations of Homer
 and the tragedians to support his claim that Timarchus has led the kind of life which, according to Athenian law,
 precludes him from speaking in the democratic assembly. Moreover, whenever Aeschines cites poetry, he uses the same wording as when he cites a law
 or an affidavit: he calls on the grammateus to read out specific
 passages, and then he comments upon them. Compare the following two passages: Ἀναγνώσεται οὖν ὑμῖν τούτους τοὺς νόμους ὁ
 γραμματεύς, ἵν᾽ εἰδῆτε ὅτι ὁ νομοθέτης ἡγήσατο τὸν
 καλῶς τραφέντα παῖδα ἄνδρα γενόμενον χρήσιμον ἔσεσθαι τῇ
 πόλει· ὅταν δ᾽ ἡ φύσις τοῦ ἀνθρώπου εὐθὺς πονηρὰν ἀρχὴν
 λάβῃ τῆς παιδείας, ἐκ τῶν κακῶς τεθραμμένων παίδων
 παραπλησίους ἡγήσατο πολίτας ἔσεσθαι Τιμάρχῳ τουτῳί.
 Λέγε αὐτοῖς τοὺς νόμους τούτους.The grammateus therefore will read out (ἀναγνώσεται) the laws for you, so that you may know that
 the lawgiver believed that the child who
 was brought up well would be a good citizen. But whenever human nature
 receives a depraved beginning to its education straightaway from childhood,
 he believed that the citizens that resulted from such badly brought up
 children would be like this man Timarchus. Read
 (λέγε) for them these laws. (Against Timarchus 11) Ἵνα δὲ καὶ διὰ τοῦ μέτρου τὰς γνώμας ἀκούσητε τοῦ
 ποιητοῦ, ἀναγνώσεται ὑμῖν ὁ γραμματεὺς τὰ ἔπη τὰ
 περὶ τούτων ἃ Ὅμηρος πεποίηκε. Λέγε πρῶτον τὰ
 περὶ τῆς Ἕκτορος τιμωρίας.In order that you may hear the sentiments of the poet in verse, the
 grammateus will read out (ἀναγνώσεται) for you the epic verses, which Homer has composed concerning these things. Read (λέγε) first the verses about the revenge against
 Hector. (Against Timarchus 147)
 Aeschines’ use of Homer and Euripides as evidence in a court case shows the student of the Athenian
 dēmos a great deal about the important role that
 poetry played in the democracy. Like written laws that guaranteed constitutional
 rights for all citizens, the poetry of Homer
 and tragedy was the common intellectual and
 moral property of the dēmos, and a standard by which
 behavior could be assessed. The law court
 with its jury of citizens was a place in which the behavior of individuals was
 constantly being evaluated in relation to the values of the polis
 as a whole. It is essential for any student of the Athenian dēmos to
 understand the authority of poetry in the civic discourse of Athens. The authority of poetry, moreover, is not
 restricted to tragedy (as we have seen) nor to
 disputes in the courts. Carolyn Higbie has shown the way in which Homer and the Iliadic ‘past’
 could be cited as authoritative evidence in all sorts of disputes, including
 Athenian claims to the island of Salamis
 and an incident that Herodotus relates in
 which the Athenians and Spartans make their claims to command of the Greek navy
 and army against the Persians before Gelon of
 Syracuse. [
 C. Higbie, “The Bones of a Hero, The Ashes
 of a Politician: Athens,
 Salamis, and the Usable
 Past.” Classical Antiquity 16 (1997):
 279-308. Athenian claims to Salamis based on Homer’s Iliad: Aristotle, Plutarch Solon
 10.2-3, Strabo, Diogenes Laertius. Command of the Greek
 army and navy against the Persians: Herodotus 7.159-161.
 ] Higbie points out that in Aristotle’s Rhetoric the philosopher cites
 poets from the past as one of two types of witnesses, the ancient and the recent
 (οἱ μὲν παλαιοὶ οἱ δὲ πρόσφατοι), and he
 notes the ancient as the more secure. He does this within in a passage in which
 he himself cites Sophocles’
 Antigone on the concept of unwritten laws. [
 Aristot. Rh. 1375a-b: καὶ περὶ μὲν τῶν νόμων οὕτως διωρίσθω· περὶ δὲ μαρτύρων,
 μάρτυρές εἰσιν διττοί, οἱ μὲν παλαιοὶ οἱ δὲ πρόσφατοι,
 καὶ τούτων οἱ μὲν μετέχοντες τοῦ κινδύνου οἱ δ᾽ ἐκτός.
 λέγω δὲ παλαιοὺς μὲν τούς τε ποιητὰς καὶ ὅσων ἄλλων
 γνωρίμων εἰσὶν κρίσεις φανεραί, οἷον Ἀθηναῖοι Ὁμήρῳ
 μάρτυρι ἐχρήσαντο περὶ Σαλαμῖνος…Witnesses are of two kinds, ancient and recent; of the latter
 some share the risk of the trial, others are outside it. By ancient
 I mean the poets and men of repute whose judgements are known to
 all; for instance, the Athenians, in the matter of Salamis, appealed to Homer as a witness (Aristotle, Rhetoric 1375b).
 ]
 Aeschines cites Homer in conjunction with tragedy throughout his orations, as do
 other orators. 3. Guarding Poetic Texts But the formula by which Aeschines calls upon
 the grammateus to read aloud a segment of poetry raises for me many
 questions. What text does the grammateus read when he is called
 upon to do so? Is it one provided by Aeschines? What kind of state texts, if any, existed for Homer and the tragedians? I would like to
 explore the question of state regulation of dramatic texts in the context of the
 definition of poetry that I have given above—that is the common
 intellectual and moral property of the dēmos. To what
 extent, and more importantly, why did the Athenian democracy regulate that
 possession? Plutarch’s Lives
 of the Ten Orators (Plut. Mor. 841F (Praecepta Gerendae Reipublicae)) mentions a
 Lycurgan law that called for official state copies of the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides to be placed
 in the Metroon: τὸν δέ, …
 χαλκᾶς εἰκόνας ἀναθεῖναι τῶν ποιητῶν, Αἰσχύλου Σοφοκλέους
 Εὐριπίδου, καὶ τὰς τραγῳδίας αὐτῶν ἐν κοινῷ γραψαμένους
 φυλάττειν καὶ τὸν τῆς πόλεως γραμματέα παραναγινώσκειν τοῖς
 ὑποκρινομένοις·[Next he proposed] that bronze statues of the poets Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides be
 set up, and that written copies of their tragedies be guarded in the public
 treasury and that the grammateus of the polis read
 them out publicly (παραναγινώσκειν) to the
 actors. (Plutarch Lives of the Ten Orators 841f) It is generally believed that this was done to protect the texts from
 actors’ or other kinds of interpolation which was corrupting the
 textual tradition of the plays and likewise their subsequent performance, and
 the verb παραναγινώσκειν has another meaning that
 may be relevant here, which is ‘to collate’ or ‘to
 compare’. That the texts would need to be protected from
 insertions is an interesting one to which I will return.  For the moment I am interested in the word φυλάττειν (‘to guard’ or ‘to
 protect’) which Plutarch tells us
 was the purpose of the law. This word has a military connotation which is
 intriguing, but it also turns the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides into a ktēma (a
 ‘possession’) of the sort Thucydides hoped his history would be (Thuc. 1.22). This is a possession that
 the Athenian dēmos wants to keep and store away in the
 Metroon in its function as a
 treasury, in order to regulate and control how that possession is used. The
 Metroon is also of course the
 Athenian archive, a place where laws are kept. The grammateus in
 fact, that same figure who as we have seen reads out the laws and affidavits and
 citations of poetry to the jury, according to the law of Lycurgus will read out the plays to the actors so that they can
 learn their parts. It is not clear whether the actors were even allowed to make
 copies for themselves (and again the meaning of the verb παραναγινώσκειν comes in to play here). 4. Poetry and the Tyrants I would like to suggest that this kind of regulation of poetry by the Athenian
 democracy is reminiscent of the control over poetry once asserted by the
 Peisistratid tyranny. Gregory Nagy, in his 1990 book 
 Pindar’s Homer
 , has shown how the possession of poetry was a primary sign of the
 tyrant’s wealth, power, and prestige. [
 G. Nagy in a chapter entitled “Epic,
 Praise, and the Posession of Poetry”
 (Pindar’s Homer [Baltimore, 1990]), p.
 158.
 ] A striking passage that he cites is Herodotus 5.90.2:  [Hdt. 5.90.2]
 ἐκτήσατο δὲ ὁ Κλεομένης ἐκ τῆς Ἀθηναίων
 ἀκροπόλιος τοὺς χρησμούς, τοὺς ἔκτηντο μὲν
 πρότερον οἱ Πεισιστρατίδαι, ἐξελαυνόμενοι δὲ ἔλιπον ἐν τῷ
 ἱρῷ, καταλειφθέντας δὲ ὁ Κλεομένης ἀνέλαβε.
 Kleomenes had taken possession of these oracular
 utterances, taking them from the acropolis of the Athenians. Previously, the
 Peisistratidae had possession of them, but, when they were driven out of
 Athens, they left them in the
 temple. It was there that Kleomenes found them
 and took them. (translation by G. Nagy) Nagy demonstrates with this passage that the oracular poetry was literally
 private property possessed by the tyrants of Athens. [
 The possession of poetry by the Peisistratids is very much related to
 establishment of the Homeric texts although this is not my focus today.
 See G. Nagy, Pindar’s Homer
 174: This possession of Musaeus by the Peisistratidae is parallel to their
 possession of Homer: there is a
 report that Onomakritos, along with three
 others, was commissioned in the reign of Peisistratos to supervise the arranging
 of the Homeric poems, which were before the scattered about
 (diethēkan houtôsi sporadēn
 ousas to prin, Anecdota Graeca 1.6 ed. Cramer).
 See also Cicero De oratore 3.137. For a parallel
 myth concerning the reassembly of the Homeric poems by Lycurgus, lawgiver of Sparta, see Plutarch Life of Lycurgus
 4.4.
 ] Nagy connects the negative image in Herodotus of the Peisistratids as hoarders of poetry with the positive
 image that the Peisistratids tried to convey of themselves as owners but at the
 same time sharers of poetry through public performance. In the pseudo-Platonic
 dialogue Hipparchus we see such a positive portrayal of Hipparchus in connection with the introduction of epic
 performances at the Panathenaia, the conveying of the poet Anacreon to Athens from Teos, Hipparchus’ patronage of Simonides of Keos, and the display of poetry on Herm statues which Hipparchus had set up in the countryside. [
 The pseudo-Platonic dialogue Hipparchus 228-229: πολίτῃ μὲν ἐμῷ τε καὶ σῷ, Πεισιστράτου δὲ ὑεῖ τοῦ
 ἐκ Φιλαϊδῶν, Ἱππάρχῳ, ὃς τῶν Πεισιστράτου παίδων ἦν

 ] But as Nagy writes on this passage: as long as private interests
 control the public medium, there is the ever-present danger of a
 premeditated selective control over the content of poetry, leading to
 stealthy distortions or perversions of the poetic truth. It is interesting that the control of poetry by tyrants threatens a perversion
 of truth, while regulation of dramatic texts by the dēmos
 serves to protect the texts from insertions or alterations and even performance
 by others. There is no guarantee of course that the Athenian state copies of
 these texts were not already quite corrupted. We know very little about the
 publication and circulation of books within the lifetime and in the century
 after the deaths of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, but it must have been sporadic and completely
 unregulated. We have no idea on what exemplar the Athenian state texts were to
 be based in the Lycurgan law. I think we can see that the
 dēmos in its attempt to protect the texts assumes the role
 that the tyrant once played in its selective control of poetry.5. Poetry &amp; the Dēmos I see state regulation of poetry as one of many points of contact with the
 Peisistratid tyranny in which the dēmos itself becomes a
 kind of ‘tyrant.’ The Tholos, for example, which housed the Prytaneis—those
 groups of 50 representatives from each of the ten tribes who held the
 ‘prytany’ or presidency of the Council of 500 in rotation and were fed in the Tholos at public expense—was
 built on the spot where a building which is thought to have been the home of the
 Peisistratids once stood. [

 Buildings in Archaic Athens.”

 Solon to Salamis
 . Princeton, 1978, p.4. J. M.
 Camp, The Athenian
 Agora: Excavations in the Heart of Classical Athens
  (London, 1986), pp. 39-40.
 ] Like many of the archaic tyrants, the Peisistratids undertook a public
 works program in which work was done on the Acropolis, the temple of Dionysus was
 built, the colossal temple of Olympian Zeus was laid
 out, and in which the Agora began to take on
 a more monumental form. [
 Shear, Jr., pp. 8-11 and Camp, pp. 39-40.
 ] The comparison with the fifth-century democratic building program is clear. Of course a more obvious point of contact between the dēmos
 and the Peisistratids for my purposes is in the origins of tragedy itself. It is likely that one of the
 first acts of the new democracy was the organization of the City Dionysia as a
 tragic festival (though proto-tragic choruses of some kind were performed under
 the Peisistratids). [
 P. Cartledge, “‘Deep
 Plays’: theatre as process in Greek civic life.’
 The Cambridge Companion to Greek Tragedy. ed. P.
 E. Easterling. Cambridge, 1997. See also Vernant in J-P. Vernant and P. Vidal-Naquet, Myth and
 Tragedy in Ancient Greece. trans. Janet Lloyd. New York,
 1990.
 ] At this critical time (that is ca 500 BC)
 comes the first stone theater of Dionysus at the foot of the Acropolis. The organization of the
 great Athenian dramatic festival at the birth of the democracy is an assertion
 of power by way of the control of poetry, not unlike the reorganization of the
 Panathenaia by the Peisistratids. More than a century and a half later after the battle
 of Chaeronea
 Athens was once again in a position in which
 it needed to assert control. Lycurgus, a prominent
 statesman with either enormous personal influence or else acting in some
 official capacity undertook at this time a building program. Among other
 projects the docks and harbors and various things in connection with the navy
 were increased and improved, and the theater of Dionysus was rebuilt.
 Lycurgus was also at this time in charge of
 festivals and processions, and in this context presumably he proposed the law
 concerning the dramatists. I stress the navy and the theater in conjunction as
 the means by which Athens, under the
 direction of Lycurgus, attempted to rebuild and
 reassert the authority of the polis after Chaeronea. Just as for the tyrants of archaic
 Greece, the possession and control of poetry and its performance was a crucial
 (though ultimately unsuccessful) demonstration of wealth, power, and prestige
 for the Athenian dēmos in the years following 338.  To conclude I would like to return to the parallels I raised in the beginning
 between citations of laws and poetry by orators as evidence in the law courts. Aeschines and other proponents of democracy name written laws to
 which all citizens are bound, that is isonomia, as the cornerstone
 of any democratic government. The Persian Otanes
 points out in Herodotus
 3.82 that tyranny and oligarchy have the power to cast aside law,
 disregard it or distort it (τῇ ἔξεστι ἀνευθύνῳ
 ποιέειν τὰ βούλεται… νόμαιά τε
 κινέει πάτρια). In a democracy, laws are the common property of
 all citizens: διοικοῦνται δ᾽ αἱ μὲν τυραννίδες καὶ ὀλιγαρχίαι
 τοῖς τρόποις τῶν ἐφεστηκότων, αἱ δὲ πόλεις αἱ δημοκρατούμεναι
 τοῖς νόμοις τοῖς κειμένοις… ὑμῖν δὲ τοῖς τὴν ἴσην καὶ ἔννομον πολιτείαν ἔχουσι τοὺς
 παρὰ τοὺς νόμους ἢ λέγοντας ἢ βεβιωκότας· ἐντεῦθεν γὰρ
 ἰσχύσετε, ὅταν εὐνομῆσθε…Autocracies and oligarchies are administered according to the tempers of
 their lords, but democratic states according to established laws. And be
 assured, fellow citizens, that in a democracy it is the laws that guard the
 person of the citizen and the constitution of the state… but you,
 who have a government based upon equality and law, must guard against those
 whose words violate the laws or whose lives have defied them; for then only
 will you be strong, when you cherish the laws (εὐνομῆσθε)… (Aeschines Against
 Timarchus 4-5)  I would point out to the student of the Athenian democracy that poetry, like the
 laws, had power, and for that reason it had to be regulated—that is
 protected and guarded against those who would violate it.  But I also think that if we focus too closely on the importance of the state
 copies for the establishment of the text we are missing the point somewhat. The
 law (in the only source in which we have it) does not specify from what exemplar
 the state copies are to be made. We will probably never know if the law did in
 fact specify such a thing. What we do know of the law is that the texts were to
 be placed in the Metroon, and
 statues of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides were to be placed in the theater. This suggests two things: 1) that the law
 had an honorific purpose, and not necessarily textual one. And 2) that the
 poetry of these three great tragedians was being symbolically elevated to the
 status of law in the civic discourse, as we so often find in the law courts and
 public speeches in the fourth
 century. [For another study of the use of
 Homeric and other poetry in the Athenian public arena, see also Andrew Ford, “Reading Homer from the Rostrum:
 Poems and Laws in Aeschines” Against
 Timarchus’ (in Performance Culture and Athenian
 Democracy, ed. Simon Goldhill and Robin Osborne,
 1999; as well as S. Perlman, “Quotations
 from Poetry in Attic Orators of the Fourth Century BCE”
 [American Journal of Philology 85 (1964):
 155-172]). Ford adduces many of the same key passages that I have
 examined here, but his argument differs from mine. Whereas Ford stresses the
 individual motives of public speakers in seeking to display their education
 and sophistication in their citations of Homeric and other poetry for their
 ad hoc legal or political argumentation, I argue for the inherent
 traditional authority of such poetic traditions, from the archaic period
 onward, in civic discourse.]Parent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Casey Dué.
