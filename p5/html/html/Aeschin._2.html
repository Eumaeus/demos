This is a speech that Aeschines composed and delivered in a trial before a jury. In 346 BCE, Aeschines and Demosthenes served together on an embassy to Philip of Macedon. The subject of the embassy was an alliance between Athens and Philip, and protection for Phocis, an ally of Athens that was at war with Thebes. The embassy was not a success -- Phocis was defeated, and Philip became stronger. When the embassy returned to Athens, Demosthenes and Timarchus accused Aeschines of treason, saying that Aeschines had been in a conspiracy with Philocrates to betray the interests of Athens, in exchange for bribes from Philip. Aeschines delayed his trial by bringing his own charges against Timarchus (see Aeschin. 1), but the matter came to trial in 343 BCE (Source for date: E. M. Harris, Aeschines and Athenian Politics [Oxford, 1995]). In the prosecuting speech, Demosthenes claims that Aeschines had been one of the loudest opponents of Philip, but changed his position abruptly to support the idea of a treaty between Philip and Athens. Demosthenes also argued that Aeschines delayed the embassy's travel to Philip, and that upon his return he gave a false report to the Assembly. Aeschines, of course, offers a different interpretation of events in this speech, and we know that the jury acquitted him of the charge (see also Aeschin. 1, Dem. 19).
