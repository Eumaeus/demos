PhilosophyThe genre of philosophy, in antiquity, was much broader in its scope than the modern discipline of the same name. Ancient philosophy dealt not only in ethics, metaphysics, and logic (the stuff of more recent philosophy), but also in the natural sciences, psychology, and political science (theory and practice). When attempting to use a work of ancient philosophy as a source for Athenian Democracy, it is important to distinguish between speculative works and descriptive ones. Speculative works (like many of Plato’s dialogues) describe hypothetical or idealized institutions; descriptive works, like many of Aristotle’s, try to describe institutions as they actually were.Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W.
