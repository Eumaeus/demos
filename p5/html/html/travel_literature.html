Travel LiteratureIn a speech from the 4th century BCE, the speaker says: Having heard reports both of this state and of the other lands where Greeks live, I desired to travel abroad. And so my father loaded two ships with grain, gave me money, and sent me off on a trading expedition and at the same time to see the world (Isoc. 17.4). Travel for the sake of seeing the sights back to the very beginning of our sources. Solon, one of the earliest historical Athenians about whom we know anything, was a famous sightseer in the 6th century BCE (Hdt. 1.30). Just like tourists today, ancient tourists wanted guidebooks to help them in their own travels, and travel literature to enjoy when they were not travelling. The genre of travel literature, technically known as ‘periegetic literature’, arose in the 3rd century BCE. The only extensive example of it that survives is the work of Pausanias of Magnesia.
