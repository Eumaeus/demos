<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>Dem. 5A TEI ProjectDem. 5Table of contents1. Dem. 51. Dem. 5 (Demosthenes, On the Peace, see also Oratory). This is a speech that Demosthenes composed for delivery at a meeting of the Assembly. The subject of the speech is a treaty of peace between Athens and Philip of Macedon, which was established in 346 BCE after Philip had captured Amphipolis, a city allied to Athens, and the Athenians were eager to prevent his taking more of their possessions (See Aeschin. 2; Dem. 19). In this speech Demosthenes argues that — although he opposed this treaty earlier, and still thinks that it was a bad idea — Athens should accept it as an accomplished fact, do nothing to undermine it for the time being, and look for other ways to advance Athenian interests. There is a problem, though regarding this speech. The speech was written in 346 BCE (source for date: Dem. 5.14; Raphael Sealey, Demosthenes and his Time: a study in Defeat (Oxford, 1993) 157-158), which makes it earlier than Demosthenes’ On the Embassy (Dem. 19), which was delivered before a jury in 343 BCE (Source for date: E. M. Harris, Aeschines and Athenian Politics [Oxford, 1995]). In that later speech, Demosthenes claims that Aeschines, alone, spoke in favor of allowing Philip to become a member of the Amphictyonic Council, the body that governed the shrines at Delphi and that was composed of representatives of various states (Dem. 19.113). But here, in On the Peace, Demosthenes says that to oppose Philip in this would be dangerous. Because of this, Libanius, a 4th century CE scholar who wrote extensively on Demosthenes, says: It seems to me that this speech was composed, but never delivered (οὗτος δὲ ὁ λόγος παρεσκευάσθαι μέν, οὐ μὴν εἰρῆσθαί μοι δοκεῖ) (Hypothesis to the Speech ’On the Peace’, 6). Would Demosthenes try to get away with such an obvious lie? Modern scholars do not agree on an answer to this question, although Sealey’s recent study assumes that Demosthenes did deliver the speech (Raphael Sealey, Demosthenes and his Time: a study in Defeat (Oxford, 1993) 157-158).
