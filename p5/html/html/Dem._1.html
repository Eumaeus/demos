<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>Dem. 1A TEI ProjectDem. 1Table of contents1. Dem. 11. Dem. 1(Demosthenesâ€™ First Olynthiac; see also oratory). This is a speech written and delivered by Demosthenes, probably in early 349 BCE (source: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 2; the date is based on a statement from Philochorus). Demosthenes gave a version of this speech at a meeting of the Assembly, and then published it later. Philip of Macedon had begun a campaign to capture the city of Olynthus, in northern Greece. The people of Olynthus had appealed to Athens for help. In this speech, and two others subsequently, Demosthenes attempts to persuade his fellow Athenians to send an armed force to the aid of Olynthus. The Athenians did send an army, but did not fund the expedition sufficiently (see Dem. 2, Dem. 3).Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
