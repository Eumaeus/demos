Dem. 50(Demosthenes’ Against Polycles; see also Oratory) Although this speech comes down to us under the name of Demosthenes, it was almost certainly written by Apollodorus, who was suing Polycles. Apollodorus is trying to recover some expenses that he, Apollodorus, had incurred after his term of duty as ‘trierarch’ (τριήραρχος), that is, after his service as a private citizen responsible for outfitting a warship for service in the Athenian navy. Polycles was the man who was supposed to take over the trierarchy after Apollodorus.The Assembly had sent and some other trierarchs to the aid of Tenos, which had been invaded by Alexander of Pherae, and to several other Greek cities that were suffering from a scarcity of grain. Because of the urgency of the mission, Apollodorus personally provided all the equipment for the ship and lavish salary for the crew. He also paid the troops that were with him because the general on board did not have sufficient funds.After reaching his destination, Apollodorus sent his rowers to search for other employment while he waited for Polycles to take over the ship, since his own the term of service as trierarch had expired. Polycles never arrived, and in the meantime, the Athenian Assembly ordered Apollodorus to convey the general Menon to the Hellespont. Apollodorus had to hire another crew of sailors, which required him to mortgage his farm.Polycles was not at the Hellespont to relieve Apollodorus. Nevertheless, the Athenian general Timomachus ordered Apollodorus to to deliver desperately needed to Hieron. Timomachus could not pay Apollodorus, and there were no other trierarchs to offset the expenses, so Apollodorus had to take out another loan to provide the money. In the meantime, Apollodorus’ father-in-law spotted Polycles in the market at Athens and urged him to finish his appointed duty and to reimburse Apollodorus for all of his expenses. Polycles refused either to assume the trierarchy or to give any financial assistance to Apollodorus.The speech was more likely given around 359 BCE (source for date: A.T. Murray, Demosthenes L [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1943] 3).
