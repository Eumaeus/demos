This is a speech written and delivered by Demosthenes, probably in the summer of 349 BCE (source: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 2; the date is based on a statement from Philochorus). Demosthenes gave a version of this speech at a meeting of the Assembly, and then published it later. This is the second of Demosthenes’ speeches in which he tried to persuade the Athenians to help the city of Olynthus resist attack by Philip of Macedon. After Demosthenes’ First Olynthiac (Dem. 1), Athens sent an armed force, but did not fund it sufficiently. Here, Demosthenes argues that Athens should spend the Theoric fund on military aid for Olynthus (see Dem. 1, Dem. 3). Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W.
