 Isocrates
 Born 436 BCE, died 338 BCE (source
 for date: OCD
 3
 ). Isocrates was the child of a wealthy
 flute-manufacturer who gave him an excellent education. He is said to have studied under
 Prodicus, Gorgias,
 Tisias, Theramenes, and Socrates. Isocrates spent the
 decade of the 390s writing speeches. However, much of
 the rest of Isocrates’ life was dedicated to
 teaching; he established a school at Athens sometime
 before 386 BCE (source for date: OCD
 3
 ). Among his students were the orators Hyperides
 and Isaeus, the historians Ephorus and Theopompus, and the atthidographer
 Androtion. Isocrates’ works are characterised by expressions of great love of
 Athens and by the promotion of ideas of
 Panhellenism, whereby, in his view, all of the Greek peoples could unite and declare war
 on the barbarous Persians. Of his works, twenty-one discourses on a wide range of topics
 and nine letters survive, most of which are considered to be genuine. (See also the genre
 of Oratory.)Christopher CottenParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher Cotten.
