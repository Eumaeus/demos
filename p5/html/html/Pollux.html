Julius Pollux was a teach and scholar of rhetoric and oratory. He was from Naucratis in Egypt, became tutor to the Emperor Commodus in Rome, and eventually took a job in Athens. He had a reputation for being unintelligent, and the one book that survives, his Dictionary (Ὀνομαστικόν) seems to many readers to be disorganized. But even so, Pollux' book contains many anecdotes that offer evidence (of greater or less reliablity) about many aspects of the ancient world.
