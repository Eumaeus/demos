Aristot. Ath. Pol.(Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians; see also philosophy). According to Hesychius, Aristotle wrote descriptions of the constitutions of individual cities, democracies, oligarchies, aristocracies, and tyrannies, 158 of them. (πολιτείας πόλεων ἰδιωτικῶν καὶ δημοκρατικῶν καὶ ὀλιγαρξικῶν καὶ ἀριστροκρατικῶν καὶ τυραννικῶν ρνη) (Source, V. Rose, Teubner ed. of Aristotle's fragments, p. 16). Of these, only this one, the Constitution of the Athenians, survives today. It comes to us in two major papyrus fragments, the first (P. Berol. 163) was acquired in 1859, and the second (P. Lond. 131) in 1888. Both papyri date from the 2nd century CE, although the text they contain was more than four hundred years older. The work itself is a short history of government at Athens, followed by a description of how the Athenian democracy operated at the time that the text was originally written. The Constitution of the Athenians, or Ath. Pol., seems to have been written after 334 BCE and before 322 BCE. Scholars do not agree on whether its author was Aristotle himself, or a member of Aristotle's school at Athens, but as P.J. Rhodes points out, this question is more important to students of Aristotle than it is to students of Athenian history.(Source, P.J. Rhodes, A Commentary on the Aristotelian Athenaion Politeia [Oxford, 1981], especially pp. 1-5, 51-53, 58-63). For the sake of convenience, we will refer to Aristotle as the author of the Constitution of the Athenians.Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
