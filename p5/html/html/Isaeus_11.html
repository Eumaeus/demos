This is a speech composed by Isaeus for Theopompus, who is being sued by the plaintiff on behalf of Theopompus' nephew. The lawsuit for which this speech was written is an outgrowth of the conflict over the estate of the deceased Hagnias and deals with many of the same issues that are addressed in Dem. 43 (Against Macartatus). According to the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia, Hagnias and his travelling companion, Telesegorus, were sent to Persia as ambassadors from Athens (Hell. Oxy. 2.1). While on their way, they were captured by the Spartan commander Pharax, who sent them off to Sparta to be killed. References to other events in the passage from the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia allow the date of Hagnias' death to be placed at 396 BCE (source for date: E.S. Forster, Isaeus [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1943] 382) during the Corinthian War. (For an ancient account of the Corinthian War, see Xen. Hell. 3-5.) The Corinthian War, erupting less than a decade after the end of the Peloponnesian War, pitted Sparta, on one side, against Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes, on the other.Hagnias left no appointed heirs and immediately after his death a great dispute arose over who would inherit his estate. In the first lawsuit involving Hagnias' estate, Glaucus and Glaucon, half-brothers of Hagnias, claimed inheritance based upon the supposed will that Hagnias left. However, this will was deemed spurious and was rejected by the court and the estate was awarded to Phylomache, the daughter of Hagnias' first cousin. The second suit was brought by Theopompus, Glaucus and Glaucon, and Eupolemus, against Phylomache. The judgement in this case was for Theopompus, who apparently proved to the satisfaction of the court that Phylomache's lineage was false and that her grandmother, also named Phylomache, never existed and could not, consequently, have been the sister of Polemon (Hagnias' father). It was apparently of no concern to the court that Theopompus was so distantly related to Hagnias that he could only claim kinship through a brother of his grandfather. The suit in Isaeus 11 concerning Theopompus and his nephew occurs shortly after this case and before Dem. 43. In this suit, Theopompus, who was a guardian of his deceased brother's son, has been sued by a fellow guardian who claims that Theopompus must split the estate settlement with his nephew. In the speech, Theopompus spends much time arguing that, since the nephew is not related to Hagnias according to the established legal standards (Isaeus 11.1-4), he cannot inherit any money from his estate. This he does quite well while skillfully evading the fact that he himself is outside the limits of kinship established by the law. In the end, Theopompus is acquitted, retaining possession of the estate for the rest of his life.Based upon the mention of the archonship of Nicophemus (361-360 BCE) in a deposition at Dem. 43.31, this speech has traditionally been dated to a few years later (middle 350s BCE). Three major factors seem to call this date into question. First, when a speech quotes a ‘law’ or a ‘deposition’, it is very likely that the quotation was not part of the original speech, but was added later (sometimes much later); this means that these quotations are not necessarily as reliable as they might initially seem (see also Oratory). Second, it might seem unlikely that the settlement of an estate would drag on for over 40 years (then again, estates can be the most difficult affairs to settle legally). Third, in Isaeus 11.48, there is a mention of Macartatus (the brother-in-law of Theopompus) outfitting a trireme and sailing it to Crete. This caused a disturbance in Athens because it was thought that such an action would lead to war with Sparta. Although there is no corroboration of this event in outside sources, historians believe that this would fit the period of Spartan naval domination prior to 378 BCE (source for date: E.S. Forster, Isaeus [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1943] 387). For these reasons, scholars have confidently been able to suggest a much earlier date for this speech.Christopher CottenParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher Cotten.
