In 340 BCE Philip of Macedon sent a letter to Athens complaining about Athenian acts of hostility toward him in the immediately preceding years (source for date: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 316). This letter arrived while Philip was besieging Perinthus, a coastal town in Thrace. Philip had also recently attacked Byzantium on the Black Sea, but that city, with help from Athens, resisted him. A text of the letter from Philip appears in Dem. 18, but that is widely thought to be a later forgery, rather than the actual text of the letter (source: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 316). This work, Dem. 12, also claims to contain the text of Philip’s letter. Although it is certainly not by Demosthenes, nor does it claim to be, it has been included in his body of works, and is now referred to as ‘Dem. 12’. We have a text, Dem. 11, that is ostensibly Demosthenes ’ public reply to Philip’s letter, a speech given in Athens. (Source: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 316-317). Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
