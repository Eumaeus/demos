 Dem. 46
 1. Dem. 46Demosthenes, Against Stephanus (II), see also Oratory. This is a speech by Apollodorus delivered
 during the same trial for which Dem. 45
 was given. Apollodorus, who is the plaintiff in the suit,
 delivered the first speech (Dem. 45), to
 which Stephanus gave a reply. This present speech is Apollodorus’ reply to Stephanus’ reply. Stephanus was a friend of
 Phormio (the same Phormio of Dem. 36) who testified on Phormio’s behalf in the special plea (παραγραφή) at the centre of that trial. The origin of this feud dates to the
 death of Pasion, an Athenian banker. According to Pasion’s will, Phormio, a
 former slave of Pasion, was given Pasion’s widow in marriage as well as control over Pasion’s business affairs until Pasion’s younger son, Pasicles, came of age.
 This arrangement did not work because of Apollodorus’
 (the older son of Pasion) greed in constantly taking from the
 common family fund. To correct this problem, and to ensure that young Pasicles was left with an inheritance when he came of age, Phormio elected to distribute all of Pasion’s property equally between the brothers. This did not satisfy
 Apollodorus, who then sued Phormio
 for 3000 drachmas (see also Money). He claimed that Phormio had withheld that sum of money when the property was
 distributed; the matter was submitted to arbitration and was it was decided that Phormio did owe the money, which he then paid (Dem. 36.3; also Dem. 36.14-15). Twenty years passed and
 Apollodorus decided that Phormio
 had defrauded him of 20 talents in bank-stock. Phormio, on the
 other hand, knew that this was preposterous and filed a special plea in bar of action (in
 other words, a plea to have the case dismissed) which is the direct concern of Dem. 36. In that speech, Phormio asserted that, since twenty years have passed, the statue of limitations
 (τὸν τῆς προθεσμίας νόμον) (Dem. 36.26) had expired and that Apollodorus had released him from any further financial obligations
 after he paid the 3000 drachmas. We learn in Apollodorus’ first address (Dem. 45.1) that Apollodorus suffered an embarrassing
 defeat in the previous case because, he claimed, he had been overwhelmed by false testimony (Dem. 45.1; see also Dem. 45.6). Apollodorus now claimed that the testimony of Phormio’s witnesses (specifically Stephanus)
 was false and that several of the documents produced by Phormio
 (the will of Pasion, Phormio’s lease of Pasion’s
 property, and Apollodorus’ statement releasing Phormio of further financial responsibility) were forged and should
 not be credited as evidence. Apollodorus further stated that
 Stephanus has merely sided with Phormio because of possible monetary gain and that he ignored a distant family
 tie to Apollodorus (Dem. 45.53-54) which, according to
 Apollodorus’ notions of proper social practice
 (Dem. 45.65), would require that he
 support Apollodorus. Finally, he closed that speech with an
 attack on the character of Phormio, ridiculing his barbarian
 (that is, non-Greek) background and accusing him of carrying on an adulterous relationship
 with Archippe, Apollodorus’ mother, which resulted in the birth of Pasicles, Apollodorus’ younger brother
 (Dem. 45.72-74; also Dem. 45.83-84). So, we now arrive at
 Apollodorus’ second speech in answer to a long
 defence made by Stephanus (Dem. 46.2). He begins this speech in the
 same way that he closed the previous one: with an attack upon the character of his
 opponent. He also continues to accuse Stephanus of false
 testimony. The body of the speech, however, contains Apollodorus’ attempt to prove that his father (Pasion) never made a will at all (see, for example, at Dem. 46.15). This, however, raises an
 important question: Why did Apollodorus wait so long to
 challenge his father’s alleged will (or, for that matter, to claim the
 bank-stock at issue in Dem. 36)? We read
 that, when Apollodorus did sue Phormio for 20 talents in bank-stock (Dem. 36), he stated that he had done so at the earliest opportunity (i.e. some twenty years later) (Dem.
 45.5). Apollodorus leaves us with no answers to this
 question. Due to the poor quality of argumentation and a lack of organisation, this speech
 is not accepted to be the work of Demosthenes. Occurring
 during the same trial, this speech can be dated simultaneously with Dem. 45, sometime after 350 BCE. (See also Dem. 36,
 Dem. 45).Christopher CottenParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
