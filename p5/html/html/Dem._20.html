Demosthenes delivered this speech in 355 BCE, and it is the first speech he made on a public matter (Source for date: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 487). The speech was delivered as part of a prosecution for illegal legislation (γραφὴ παρανόμων). The case was this: the Athenian democracy relied on its wealthy citizens to pay for certain public works; these were called ‘liturgies’ (λειτουγίαι) (see the article, Liturgies). Occasionally, too, the democracy would honor one of its citizens by granting him immunity from liturgies—he and his descendants would no longer be called upon to pay for a service. In 357 BCE, a man named Leptines had proposed a law that would end all such exceptions from liturgies, thus providing Athens with additional sources of funds. The law was approved by the Nomothetae (see also Assembly; at Dem. 20.144, Demosthenes says that more than a year had elapsed between the passage of the law and the trial). Two other Athenians had brought a charge of illegal legislation against Leptines, but let the case drop (Dem. 20.145). A second charge was brought against the law, and Demosthenes gave this speech making the case against it. Leptines himself spoke in the law’s defense (Dem. 20.146).
