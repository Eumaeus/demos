Dinarchus was an orator who made his career in Athens (see Oratory). He was born in Corinth and so, as a resident alien or ‘metic’ (μέτοικος), he was not eligible to speak publicly in the Assembly or the courts. So, when a speech by Dinarchus is cited as evidence, it should be understood that this was a speech he wrote for an Athenian citizen to deliver before a jury or in the Assembly. He came to prominence in 324 or 323, when he wrote a speech prosecuting the orator Demosthenes for having allegedly taken bribes from the Macedonian Harpalus (see Din. 1); two other speeches by him also relate to this trial (see Din. 2, Din. 3) (source for date: J. O. Burtt, Minor Attic Orators [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb, 1980] 165). (See also the genre of Oratory.)Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
