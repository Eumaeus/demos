SummaryCimon, son of Miltiades (father) and
      Hegesipyle (mother), was a prominent Athenian in the first half of the 5th century BCE. He was instrumental in
     leading Athens to a dominant position in the Greek world
     after the Persian Wars, and he opposed the more radical
     democratic reforms of Ephialtes and Pericles, particularly their reform of the Court of the
      Areopagus.2. Introduction: Cimon’s Family and CharacterIn the early 5th century BCE
     Athens became increasingly more democratic as the older
     institutions, which were dominated by the wealthy, lost power to newer institutions that were
     in the hands of the People. This change was not welcomed by
     everyone, and even a hundred years later, an aristocratic Athenian like Isocrates could complain of how, after the Persian Wars, the city grew powerful and seized the
      empire of the Greeks, and our fathers, growing more self-assured than was proper for them,
      began to look with disfavor on those good men and true who had made Athens great, envying them their power, and growing to look instead to men who
      were low-born and full of insolence (Isoc. 15.316). When he outlines the history of the government of
      Athens, Aristotle notes
     that at this critical point in the history of the democracy, the leadership of the People was held by Ephialtes, while the
     wealthy Athenians followed Cimon (Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      28.2).Cimon’s deme, the district in Attica where he was
     registered as a citizen, was Laciadae (Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      27.3), and he was of the tribe (φυλή) Oineis (Plut. Cim. 17.3-6).Cimon’s father was Miltiades, a famous
     Athenian, and his mother was Hegesipyle, who was not an Athenian but
     the daughter of Olorus, king of Thrace (Plut.
       Cim. 4.1; Aristot. Ath. Pol. 26.1; Hdt. 6.39.2). The family was
     very wealthy. His father, Miltiades, had been general on a failed military expedition to Paros in 490 or 489 BCE
     (source for date: Rhodes, 324-325), and had been fined for that
     failure. When Miltiades died, his son Cimon paid the fine, which was 50 talents, a vast sum of money (Hdt. 6.136.3; Plut. Cim. 4.4).
      Aristotle says that Cimon
     had an estate large enough for a tyrant, but adds this comment on his reputation
     for generosity: anyone of the Laciadae who liked
      could come to his house every day and have a moderate supply, and also all his farms were
      unfenced, to enable anyone who liked to avail himself of the harvest. (Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      27.2-3; Plutarch tells the same story at Plut. Cim. 10.1
     -2). Demosthenes, writing in the 4th century BCE, suggests that Cimon had a
     reputation for modesty, citing him as an example of how, in the ‘old days’
     of the early 5th century, the houses of wealthy and famous
     Athenians were no different from those of ordinary citizens (Dem. 13.29). It is possible that
      Cimon had also been a victor in the games at Olympia (Andoc. 4.33).3. Cimon’s Early CareerCimon came to public prominence for the first time, it seems, in
      480 BCE, when the army from Persia was marching toward Athens (source for
     date: OCD
      3
     ). Faced with an invasion of Attica, the politician
      Themistocles urged the Athenians to abandon the territory of
      Attica to the enemy, take refuge on the island of
      Salamis and in the Peloponnese, and trust in Athens’ fleet of
     warships. Cimon made a flamboyant and effective gesture of support
     for this proposal: he marched up to the Acropolis and gave his horse’s bridle as a gift to the goddess Athene, thus indicating that he would not need his cavalry equipment, since he would
     trust in the navy. In the ensuing naval battle off the island of Salamis he performed bravely, and from those events became well known in
      Athens (Plut. Cim. 5.2-3).Many ancient writers, often unsympathetic or actively hostile toward the idea of democracy,
     describe the history of Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries as an ongoing
     struggle between the rich and the poor (who were often referred to as the People)—or between ‘aristocracy’ (after
      aristoi, ‘the best people,’ a euphemism for the rich) and
      ‘democracy’ (after the demos, the People)—with prominent Athenians championing one side or the other. Aristotle, for example, summarizes Athenian history in terms of
     this struggle, saying that at the end of the 6th century
     Cleisthenes took the side of the People, while Isagoras represented the rich; later, Xanthippus took the side of the People, and
      Miltiades took the side of the rich; and then, after the Persian Wars, Themistocles and Ephialtes took the side of the People,
     while Aristides and Cimon took the side
     of the rich (Aristot. Ath.
       Pol. 28.2). Plutarch tells the same story of
      ‘party politics’ (Plut. Cim. 5.4), and goes so far as to say that Cimon restored Athens to a the
      legendary community of Cronus (τὴν ἐπὶ
      Κρόνου μυθολογουμένην κοινωνίαν) by resisting Themistocles and Ephialtes as they tried to enact
     democratic reforms (Plut.
       Cim. 10.6-8).4. Cimon’s SuccessesCimon enjoyed this influence over affairs because he was a very
     successful general, politician, and perhaps self-promoter. After the Persian Wars, when the Athenians were rebuilding their city (it
     had been sacked by the Persians in 480 [source for date: OCD
       3
      , see also Hdt.
       8.50.2]), Cimon acted on a message from the god Apollo, delivered to the Athenians through the oracle at Delphi; the message urged Athens
     to find the bones of their legendary king Theseus and return them
     for burial in Attica. Cimon
     found a large skeleton on the island of Scyros and returned
     with it, triumphantly, to Athens (Plut. Thes.
     36.1-3; Plut.
       Cim. 8.3-7; Paus. 1.17.6; Paus. 3.3.7; Thuc. 1.98.2; Diod. 11.60.2). We also hear of Cimon and
      Aristides—both advocates of an aristocratic government (Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      28.2; Plut.
       Cim. 10.7)—sent as an embassy to Sparta in 479, just after Athens and Sparta had led the Greeks in
     driving the Persians from Greece (Plut. Arist.
      10.10; source for date: Rhodes, 293). According to Pausanias, Cimon was instrumental in
     fortifying the newly rebuilt Acropolis with
     walls (Paus.
     1.28.3).In the years 478-477, when the Persians has left the
     Greek mainland but were still a threat to the Greek islands in the Aegean, the Spartans held leadership of a coalition of Greek states united for
     protection from Persia (Plut. Cim. 6.1;
     source for date: OHCW). But the Spartan king Pausanias mismanaged the alliance,
     while Cimon, who was in the Aegean as an Athenian general (στρατηγός), acted fairly, thus helping to bring many island-states
     into alliance with Athens (Plut. Cim.
     6.2).Those years also marked the beginning of a series of naval battles between Persia and Athens, under the
     command of Cimon, that would, by 467,
     eliminate the Persian threat to the Greeks in the Aegean;
     the first of these battles was in the north, in Thrace,
     where Cimon attacked the Persians and liberated the city of
      Eion (Plut. Cim. 7.1; Thuc. 1.98.1; source for
     date: OHCW). Pausanias (the writer from the 2nd century CE, no relation to the Spartan king of the same name) reports
     that Cimon pioneered the use of running water to undermine brick
     walls (which resist battering rams better than stone, he says) during the siege of Eion (Paus. 8.8.9). Cimon’s victory at Eion in Thrace opened the way for Athens to control territory in northern Greece, including the city of Amphipolis
      (Plut. Cim.
      8.2).Cimon’s greatest moment, however, was in 467, when he commanded the Athenian fleet in a battle against the Persians near the
     mouth of the river Eurymedon (Plut. Cim.
     12.1-6; Thuc.
      1.100.1; source for date: OHCW). After his fleet had beaten the Persian fleet, it landed troops which another victory
     on land (Plut.
       Cim. 13.1-2). Cimon won yet another victory
     immediately afterwards against a fleet of Phoenician ships that were part patrolling near
      Hydrus on behalf of Persia (Plut.
       Cim. 13.3). He became famous as the one general who won a victory on
     land and on sea on the same day (Paus. 1.29.14). The result of these victories was a treaty between the
     Greeks and the Great King of Persia, ending the Persian threat to the Greeks, at least for the moment (Plut. Cim.
     13.4).Athens was still the leading city of the defensive
     alliance of Greek states, many of which grew tired of providing ships for the common defense;
     according to Plutarch, Cimon
     allowed them to pay money instead of contributing ships, money that the Athenians used to
     expand their own fleet, which would provide protection to all the allies. Thus, before
      they knew it, they were tribute-paying subject rather than allies (Plut. Cim.
     11.1-3; compare Thuc.
      1.99, which tells the same story without mentioning Cimon).
     This was the birth of the Athenian ‘empire’ (ἀρχή) that would shape the city’s history in the 5th
      century (for the term, see Thuc. 1.67.4; Thuc. 1.75).Plutarch tells the following story to illustrate Cimon’s prestige during these years when he was one of the ten generals elected by the Athenians. On the occasion when the
     tragedian Sophocles was producing his first tragedies in the
      Theater of Dionysus, putting them in
     competition with some tragedies of Aeschylus, the crowd was
     in an uproar, excited by the young poet’s challenge to the old master. When Cimon and his fellow generals entered the theater, the
      archon chose them to judge the competition, rather than
     selecting ten judges at random. Cimon’s reputation calmed the crowd
     and prevented a riot when the ‘upstart’
     Sophocles won the competition (Plut. Cim.
     8.7-8). This happened in 468 BCE (source for date: OHCW).5. The Beginning of Conflict with the DemocratsPlutarch praises Cimon for his
     opposition to the democratic reforms of Themistocles and Ephialtes (Plut. Cim. 10.7). The beginnings of this opposition, as far as we can
     tell, arose from an incident on one of Cimon’s military campaigns in
     the north. While the Persians had been mostly driven from the Aegean sea, they remained in the Chersonese, a peninsula in the northern Aegean, and allied themselves with some of the people of Thrace; the Athenians dispatched Cimon to wage war
     against them (Plut.
       Cim. 14.1). Cimon won a victory in
      Thrace, which allowed him, had he wished to, to invade
      Macedonia. When he failed to do this, he was brought to
     trial in Athens, accused of accepting bribes to leave
      Macedonia alone; one of the prosecutors at his trial
     was Pericles (Plut. Cim. 14.2-3). Cimon
     spoke well in his own defense (Plut. Cim. 14.3) and was acquitted, but this trial, at least as Plutarch narrates Cimon’s career,
     marked the beginning of a period of confrontation between him and the democratic reformers
      (Plut. Cim.
      15.1-2; Plut.
       Cim. 10.7).Cimon was the proxenos (πρόξενος) or
      ‘official representative’ of Sparta in
      Athens, a position similar to that of an ambassador,
     except that the proxenus was a citizen of the foreign city, not of the city he
     represented (Plut.
       Cim. 14.3; Paus. 4.24.6). Cimon’s relationship with
      Sparta was close; he cited that relationship, as evidence
     of his good character, in his own defense at his trial (Plut. Cim.
     14.3), and even named one of his sons Lacedaemonius, or
      ‘Spartan’ (Thuc. 1.45.2; Plut.
       Cim. 16.1; Aristotle makes some
     unflattering comments about Cimon’s children at Aristot. Rh.
      1390b). This relationship was helpful to Athens,
     and reflected well on Cimon in the eyes of his fellow citizens,
     while Sparta and Athens
     were allies in the struggle against Persia, but as the two
     cities became rivals, Sparta’s proxenus came
     to be regarded with some suspicion (Plut. Cim. 16.4-6).In 464 BCE, an earthquake struck the Peloponnese in the area around Sparta, and
     the helots (εἵλως, εἱλώτης), a large population of serfs controlled by the Spartans, took the disaster
     as an opportunity to revolt from their masters; the Spartans send messages to Athens asking for help in putting down this rebellion (Plut. Cim.
     16.4-7; Paus.
      1.29.8; source for date: OHCW). Aristophanes makes a joking reference to this event
     in his play Lysistrata, where Lysistrata chides some
     Spartans, saying: You must remember, not so long ago, you sent a man to Athens begging us, on bended knee and whiter than a ghost, to sent
      an army? All your slaves were up in arms when that big earthquake hit you. We send you help,
      four thousand infantry (Aristoph. Lys. 1138)—not so long ago is misleading,
     since Lysistrata was produced in 411 BCE, fifty three years after the
     helot-uprising (source for date: OHCW).Ephialtes opposed sending help to Sparta, but Cimon argued in favor of doing so and
     persuaded the Athenians (Plut.
       Cim. 16.8). After this successful intervention, the Spartans called for
     help from Athens a second time, in 462
      BCE, when they were besieging a group of rebellious helots in the town of Ithome, in Messenia (source for
     date: OHCW). Again the Athenians sent a military force, under Cimon’s
     command, but once the army arrived in Messenia, the
     Spartans sent them back again (Plut. Cim. 17.2; Thuc. 1.102; Paus. 1.29.8). Plutarch says, the army came back home in a rage,
      and at once took open measures of hostility against the pro-Spartan people, and above all
      against Cimon (Plut. Cim.
     17.2); Cimon was ostracized,
     a process by which the people of Athens voted to expel him
     from the city for a period of ten years (Plut. Cim. 17.2; Andoc. 4.33; Andoc. 3.3; Plut. Per.
     9.4).When Plutarch describes Cimon’s
      ostracism at Plut. Cim. 17.2, he suggests that it was motivated by
      Athens’ anger at their humiliating dismissal by the
      Spartans—Cimon, the proxenus of Sparta would have been a natural target for that anger. But there may
     have been more to it than that. We have reason to think that while Cimon was away in Messenia with an Athenian
     army, the people in Athens, under the leadership of Ephialtes and Pericles, enacted a radical
     democratic reform by limiting the powers of the Court of the
      Areopagus.6. Democratic Reforms Behind Cimon’s BackFirst there is the question of why the Spartans, after summoning the Athenians to help,
     suddenly changed their minds and dismissed them. Plutarch
     says that the Spartans saw the Athenians as revolutionaries (νεωτεριστάς) (Plut. Cim. 17.2). Thucydides expands on this, saying that the Spartans, apprehensive of the
      enterprising and revolutionary character of the Athenians, and further looking upon them as
      foreigners, began to fear that if they remained, they might be tempted by the besieged in
       Ithome to attempt some political changes. They
      accordingly dismissed them alone of the allies, without declaring their suspicions, but merely
      saying that they had now no need of them (δείσαντες τῶν
      Ἀθηναίων τὸ τολμηρὸν καὶ τὴν νεωτεροποιίαν, καὶ ἀλλοφύλους ἅμα ἡγησάμενοι, μή τι, ἢν
      παραμείνωσιν, ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν Ἰθώμῃ πεισθέντες νεωτερίσωσι, μόνους τῶν ξυμμάχων ἀπέπεμψαν, τὴν μὲν
      ὑποψίαν οὐ δηλοῦντες, εἰπόντες δὲ ὅτι οὐδὲν προσδέονται αὐτῶν ἔτι) (Thuc. 1.102).Second, there are several passages from ancient authors that say that democratic reforms were
     passed in Athens while Cimon was
     away. Plutarch suggests this, in very general terms, in his
     biography of Pericles. Once Aristides was
     dead, Plutarch says, and Themistocles was banished and Cimon was generally absent on
     campaigns, Pericles decided to devote himself to the people,
      espousing the cause of the poor and the many instead of the few and the rich, contrary to his
      own nature, which was anything but popular (Plut. Per. 7.2).
     In his biography of Cimon he is more specific, saying that after
      Cimon’s trial and acquittal, he opposed any democratic reforms,
      but when he sailed away again on military service, the People got completely beyond control. They confounded the established political order
      of things and the ancestral practices which they had formerly observed, and under the lead of
       Ephialtes they robbed the Council of the
       Areopagus of all but a few of the cases in its jurisdiction (Plut. Cim.
     15.1).Third, there is evidence to suggest that democratic reforms, and particularly a reform of the
      Court of the Areopagus, were enacted specifically by the
      People generally, the dēmos (δῆμος), in the absence of Cimon and the wealthier
     Athenians. Diodorus says that it was the Assembly (ἐκκλησία), the most
     democratic institution in Athens, that reformed the Court of the Areopagus (Diod. 11.77.6). More
     interesting still, Aristotle attributes the democratic
     reforms after the Persian Wars, and particularly the
     changes to the Court of the Areopagus, to the naval
      multitude (ὁ ναυτικὸς ὄχλος) (Aristot. Pol.
      1304a). This naval multitude refers to the citizens who were not wealthy
     enough to provide themselves with bronze armor, but could nevertheless serve as rowers on
     warships.Fourth, and finally, Plutarch’s biography of Pericles, unlike his biography of Cimon,
     explicitly connects Cimon’s ostracism with Ephialtes’ reform of the Court of the Areopagus,
     which he calls here the ‘
      Council of the Areopagus
     ’:  Not only was the Council robbed of most of its jurisdiction by Ephialtes, but Cimon also, on the charge of
      being a lover of Sparta and a hater of the people, was ostracized
      (Plut. Per.
      9.4).If we put these four categories of evidence together, we might (tentatively) reconstruct
     events as follows: In 462 BCE the Spartans sent for Athenian help
     during the siege of Ithome in Messenia. Cimon marched south with an army that
     consisted of those Athenians wealthy enough to afford the bronze armor necessary for fighting
     on land. While this army was gone, the Assembly at Athens, with a smaller-than-usual number of wealthy citizens
     participating, passed democratic reforms, including a reform of the Court of the Areopagus. Word of this reached Sparta, and the Spartans (who did not look kindly on reform, certainly not
     democratic reform) decided that the Athenians were dangerous to have around and so dismissed
     them. Upon returning to Athens, Cimon, who was known for his good relationship with Sparta and for opposing reforms such as had just been passed, was ostracized.It is important to note that the preceding paragraph is one possible interpretation of a few
     pieces of evidence. The evidence, by itself, does not give a full, or consistent, picture of
     events.7. The Reforms that Cimon OpposedFor a full description of the Court of the Areopagus
     (sometimes called the ‘Council of the Areopagus,’ and sometimes simply ‘the Areopagus’, after the Hill of the
      Areopagus, where it convened) and the reforms of 462 BCE, see
     the entries under Court of the Areopagus and Ephialtes. What follows is a very condensed account, to illustrate the
     democratic changes to the government of Athens that Cimon opposed.In the earliest stages of the Athenian government that our sources describe, the Court of the Areopagus was the most important governing body. It
     was also a very aristocratic body. Aristotle says that before
     the fifth century, The Council of the Areopagus had the official function of guarding the laws, but actually
      it administered the greatest number and the most important of the affairs of state, inflicting
      penalties and fines upon offenders against public order without appeal; for the elections of
      the Archons went by birth and wealth, and the members of the
       Areopagus were appointed from them, owing to which this
      alone of the offices has remained even to the present day tenable for life (Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      3.6). In the time of Draco, who (according to legend) first
     gave Athens a code of laws, The Council of the Areopagus was guardian of he laws, and kept a watch
      on the magistrates (τὰς ἀρχάς) to make them govern in
      accordance with the laws. A person unjustly treated might lay a complaint before the Council of the Areopagus, stating the law in contravention of
      which he was treated unjustly (Aristot. Ath. Pol. 4.4). Both of these passages are
     rather vague as to the details of the functions of the Court of the
      Areopagus, but its importance is clear.As Athens became gradually more democratic, in the years
     leading up to the Persian Wars (c. 481-479 BCE: source OHCW), the Areopagus seems to have lost some of its
     authority. Aristotle says in his Politics that
      Solon—the partly legendary, partly historical Athenian lawgiver of
     the early 6th century BCE (source: OCD
      3
     )—reformed the Athenian constitution by mixing democratic elements (the law-courts), aristocratic elements (the elected offices) and oligarchic elements (the Council of the
      Areopagus) (Aristot.
       Pol. 1273b). However, during the chaos of the Persian invasion in 480 BCE, the Council of the Areopagus
     took a leading role in organizing, and financing, the evacuation of all Athenians to Salamis and the Peloponnese, which raised the body’s status considerably (Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      23.1).While the evacuation of Athens raised the prestige of the
      Areopagus, the ensuing battle in the sea by Salamis may have helped bring about its later fall from power. The
     victory at Salamis was won by Athens’ fleet, which was
     manned by the general population who may have assumed that their role in the defense of
      Athens entitled them to a greater role in the city’s
     governance. Aristotle explicitly contrasts this
      ‘naval crowd’ with the Council of the
      Areopagus: …as for example the Council of the
       Areopagus having risen in reputation during the Persian
       Wars was believed to have made the constitution more rigid, and then again the naval
      multitude, having been the cause of the victory off Salamis and thereby of the leadership of Athens due to her power at sea, made the democracy stronger (οἷον ἡ ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ βουλὴ εὐδοκιμήσασα ἐν τοῖς Μηδικοῖς ἔδοξε συντονωτέραν
      ποιῆσαι τὴν πολιτείαν, καὶ πάλιν ὁ ναυτικὸς ὄχλος γενόμενος αἴτιος τῆς περὶ Σαλαμῖνα νίκης καὶ
      διὰ ταύτης τῆς ἡγεμονίας διὰ τὴν κατὰ θάλατταν δύναμιν τὴν δημοκρατίαν ἰσχυροτέραν
      ἐποίησεν) (Aristot.
       Pol. 1304a).In the years following the Persian Wars, we know of two
     events, particularly, that may have motivated the advocates of democracy to try to limit the
     authority of the Council of the Areopagus. First, Themistocles, who was a leader of those who favored democracy (Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      28.2; Plut.
       Cim. 5.4; Plut. Cim. 10.6), was brought to trial before the Council of the Areopagus on charges that he had improper dealings
     with Persia (Aristot. Ath. Pol. 25.3). Second, Cimon, who as we have seen was an opponent of democratic reforms (Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      28.2; Plut.
       Cim. 5.4; Plut. Cim. 10.6), was acquitted by the Areopagus when he was charged with failing to invade Macedonia (Plut.
       Cim. 15.1-2; Plut. Cim. 10.7).The ancient sources are in agreement that in 462 BCE
     Cimon was the principle opponent of reform to the powers of the
      Council of the Areopagus (see, for example Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      26.1; Plut.
       Per. 9.4; Plut. Cim. 15.1; source for date: OCD
      3
     ). The sources do not agree, however, as to who initiated that reform. Plutarch says that it was Ephialtes
     who, broke down the power of the Council of the
       Areopagus (Plut.
       Per. 7.6). At one point in the Constitution of the
      Athenians
     Aristotle says But as the population increased, Ephialtes son of Sophonides, having become
      head of the People and having the reputation of being
      incorruptible and just in regard to the constitution, attacked the Council of the Areopagus (Aristot. Ath. Pol. 25.1). But elsewhere in the same work
     he says that the reform was organized by Ephialtes and Themistocles (Aristot. Ath. Pol. 25.3), and elsewhere still, he
     mentions Pericles attacking the Council of
      the Areopagus (Aristot.
       Ath. Pol. 27.1). Plutarch also
     mentions Pericles at Plut. Per. 9.3. We should probably conclude, although
     cautiously, that Ephialtes was the principle reformer, but that he
     acted with the advice and support of Pericles. Ephialtes is the name most often associated with the reforms, and the following
     passage from Plutarch suggests that, while Pericles was a leader of the democratic movement, it was Ephialtes who enacted this particular reform: For this reason all
      the more did Pericles, strong in the affections of the people, lead a successful party against the Council of the Areopagus. Not only was the Council robbed of most of its jurisdiction
      by Ephialtes, but Cimon also, on the
      charge of being a lover of Sparta and a hater of the people, was ostracized.
      (Plut. Per.
      9.4).What were the reforms? They are discussed at length in the articles on Ephialtes and on the Court of the Areopagus, but they
     can be summarized briefly here. Plutarch says that the Council of the Areopagus lost jurisdiction over almost all
      kriseis, judgements (κρίσεις)
      (Plut. Cim.
      15.2; Plut.
       Per. 9.5). Aristotle is vague, saying
     that the Council of the Areopagus was deprived of
      superintendence of affairs (ἀπεστερήθη τῆς
      ἐπιμελείας) (Aristot.
       Ath. Pol. 26.1). Our best evidence for what authority remained in the
     hands of the Council of the Areopagus comes from subsequent
     trials that appeared before it. These include trials for homicide, assault and battery, certain
     religious offenses, and arson (Lys.
      7.22; Dem. 23.22;
      Dem. 59.79; Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      57.3; Aristot.
       Ath. Pol. 60.2).Immediately after describing the reform of the Court of the
      Areopagus, Aristotle mentions that Pericles first introduced pay for citizens who served on juries in the
     court of the Heliaia (Aristot. Ath. Pol.
      27.2). This might indicate that, with many kinds of court cases no longer appearing
     before the Areopagus, there was greater need for citizen
     jurors.8. Cimon’s Last Years and DeathCimon had been ostracized in
      462, which meant that he was exiled from Athens for ten years (Plut. Cim. 17.2; Andoc. 4.33; Andoc. 3.3; Plut. Per. 9.4).
     In 458 BCE, however, when Sparta
     and Athens were at war and facing each other for battle at
      Tanagra, Cimon volunteered
     himself to fight for the city. The Athenians refused his services, but when his tribe, the
      Oeneidae, fought well (though they died to the last
     man), the Athenians had a change of heart, and Pericles himself
     persuaded them to bring Cimon back from exile (Plut. Cim.
     17.3-6; source for date: OCD
      3
     ).Around 450 BCE, Cimon negotiated a
     treaty between Athens and Sparta, thus (temporarily) bringing an end to the war (Thuc. 1.112.1; see also the
     comments at Aeschin. 2.172
     and Andoc. 3.3, which are not
     consistent).Cimon’s last years saw him return to the calling in which he had
     his greatest success, leading Athenian warships against Persian enemies. He led an Athenian
     military expedition to fight against the Persians in Egypt
      (Plut. Cim.
      18.1-7). He died at Citium, either from an illness
     or from a wound (Plut.
       Cim. 19.1; Thuc. 1.112.4).9. Secondary Works CitedJohn Boardman, Jasper Griffin, Oswyn Murray, Oxford History
