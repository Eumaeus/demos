This is a speech that Demosthenes wrote for a man named Mantitheus, who was suing his half-brother Boeotus. In Athens, a man was known by his given name (e.g. Mantitheus), plus either his father’s name (e.g. Mantitheus son of Mantias), and the name of his deme, his local district in Attica (e.g. Mantitheus son of Mantias from Thoricus). In the case for which this speech was written, Mantitheus is suing his half-brother Boeotus because, the plaintiff claims, Boeotus has tried to assume the name Mantitheus himself. Needless to say, if both plaintiff and defendant use the same given name, and both have the same father and both come from the same deme, great confusion is likely to result. The plaintiff here claims that he was his father’s legitimate son and was registered in the deme’s roll under the name Mantitheus, thus having claim to the name. Despite the fact that the plaintiff’s case seems clear-cut, it is almost certain that the plaintiff lost the case—in Dem. 40, this same Mantitheus is suing this same Boeotus over a different matter, and at Dem. 40.18 we find that the suit was officially lodged against ‘Mantitheus’, suggesting that after the first trial, ‘Boeotus’ was allowed to continue using the name ‘Mantitheus’. This case should serve as a reminder of the possible problems with using speeches as evidence; in the case of Mantitheus vs. Boeotus, there were two sides to the argument, and the one we have seems to have been the worse one. The speech was probably written in 348 BCE (Source for date: R.
