 Aeschin. 1
 1. Aeschin. 1(Aeschines, Against Timarchus, see also Oratory). This is a speech that Aeschines
 composed and delivered in a trial before a jury. In
 346 BCE, Aeschines and Demosthenes served together on an embassy to Philip of Macedon. The subject
 of the embassy was an alliance between Athens and
 Philip, and protection for Phocis, an ally of Athens that was at
 war with Thebes. The embassy was not a success, and in
 345 BCE
 Demosthenes and Timarchus
 brought charges of treason against Aeschines, claiming
 that he had been bribed to betray Athenian interests to Philip
 (Source for date: E. M. Harris, Aeschines and Athenian Politics
 [Oxford, 1995]). In order to delay his own treason trial, Aeschines brought charges against Timarchus, alleging that he had been a prostitute, which was illegal for an
 Athenian Citizen. Demosthenes defended Timarchus (that speech is lost), but Aeschines won his case. Thus, Aeschinesâ€™ tactic worked, and Demosthenes (alone) waited until 343 BCE to resume his prosecution (see Aeschin. 2, Dem. 19). (See also the genre
 Oratory.)Parent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
