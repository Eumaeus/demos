One of the so-called ‘Atthidographers’, the ancient scholars who wrote histories of Attica and Athens (see History). He wrote at least twenty-seven works, including histories of Delos and Salamis, works on sacrifice and cults, and studies of Greek poetry. His most famous work was his history of Athens, his Atthis. This work does not survive, but we do have over 170 ‘fragments’ of it, quotations from the work in other, surviving, ancient authors. He seems to have exercised critical judgement when choosing his sources; he approved of his predecessor Androtion, but was critical of the historian Demon and even devoted a book to pointing out Demon’s faults. Based on the fragments that survive, we can tell that Philochorus was familiar with Herodotus and Thucydides. He was put to death by Antigonus Gonatas around 260 BCE, for supporting Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
