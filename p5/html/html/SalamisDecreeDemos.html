  Hansen. Luria first suggested klero/xos, ‘cleruchs,’ citizens of Athens who
 lived in an extension of the Athenian state overseas (Graham
 1983, 167ff.). Such a restoration would represent the earliest attestations
 of a cleruchy, dating to the period of or just after the Cleisthenic
 reforms. Other restorations suggest ‘Athenians,’ an
 individual Athenian, ‘hoplite soldiers’ or
 ‘inhabitants,’ the last side-stepping the issue of
 the dwellers’ legal status. Matthaiou’s publication of a
 new fragment confirms an accusative plural, either κληρόχος or Ἀθεναίος.11.2. 2: αἰρεὶ π…2: αἰρεὶ πλὲν ὅτι δεῖ0

 The proposed restorations all focus on the same notion: that the cleruchs on
 Salamis were subjected to the same
 taxation and military levy as those residing in Athens. Financial and military obligations were common for
 cleruchs, although the land owned in a cleruchy was not part of a
 citizen’s land-holding assessment for liturgical obligations in
 Athens (Dem. 14.16; M.H. Hansen,
 Demography and democracy : the number of Athenian citizens in the
 fourth century B.C. [Herning, Denmark: Systime 1986], n.218). A
 4th century BCE inscription, IG 2.2.30, also from the
 Athenian Acropolis, that deals with land ownership on Lemnos probably refers to the cleruchy on
 Salamis and may even cite the
 stipulations in IG 1.3.1 as legal precedents for action taken
 in 387/6 (Stroud,
 Hesperia 40 [1971] 172-73). For line 2 here, I prefer
 Meritt’s restoration, as Fornara has rendered it: forever,
 except that they must at Athens

 Wade-Gery. The restorations vary widely in the amount of rent tax, from as
 much as 300% (Tod) of the rent to as little as 10% (Wade-Gery). Surely the
 latter is more likely, since the exactment of the former for leasing to a
 relative (l. 4, Wade-Gery) or dweller (Meritt) would be punitive.11.5. 7-8: χσυλέ…7-8: χσυλέγεν δὲ τὸν ἄ|rxonta,

 restoration suggests that the archon will muster troops in the event of an
 emergency, rather than the more probable reference to the archon’s 
 euthyna
 , or examination, conducted at the termination of his tenure in
 office. Public officials were held accountable for their service to the
 dēmos, including the (mis)management of state funds (Aristot. Ath. Pol. 45.2-45.3; 48.3-48.4; 54.2); evidence of malfeasance
 presented at the 
 euthyna
  could be contested and then resolved in the 
 dikasteria
  (Arist. Ath. Pol. 48.5; OCD s.v.
 
 euthyna
 ).11.6. 12: tau=t’…12:

 stipulations conclude with a reference to the proposer of an amendment, or
 that the preceding legislation had been drafted by the Council, Cleisthenes’ new boulē of 500 (which replaced the earlier
 Solonian boulē of 400). The
 suggestion that the archon was Boleklēs has not received
 much support.12. Historical CommentaryIn the aftermath of the reforms of Cleisthenes of 508/7
 BCE, the new Athenian democracy sought to establish a presence in
 the Saronic Gulf against its
 Peloponnesian (led by Sparta) and Isthmian (led by Corinth)
 opponents. The nearby island of Aegina and
 the city-state of Corinth adjacent to the
 Isthmus both had spheres of interest in
 the Saronic Gulf. These and other
 
 poleis
  were active members of the Peloponnesian League, which was led by
 Sparta and included Athens. The island of Salamis, which Athens had
 seized in the age of Pisistratus the
 tyrant ca. 560 BCE (Paus. 1.3.3, 9.6.2), provided the ideal base for such a presence. This,
 the earliest decree of the Athenian 
 dēmos
 , addresses the rights and responsibilities of 
 kleruchoi
  or ‘cleruchs’ (Athenian citizens dwelling outside
 of Athens who retain their citizenship) settled by Athens on the island: cleruchs must pay taxes and provide
 military services to Athens, they may lease
 the land only to kinsmen (the text here is fragmentary and may refer instead to
 a dweller) on penalty of a fine, and they must provide their own weapons. The
 text also refers to an Athenian archon
 [here, the local governor, as at LSJ s.v. a)/rxon, II.2; cf. Aristot. Ath. Pol.
 54.7-8]), whose responsibilities seem to focus on military assessment,
 and the boulē or Council of 500
 (Paus. 1.3.5)
 recently created by Cleisthenes.Who are these settlers, and what does their relocation to Salamis
 ca. 510-500 BCE tell us about the
 constitutional reforms of Cleisthenes? The
 inscription has long been recognized as the first extant Athenian decree and so
 has undergone considerable scrutiny. Although the various provisions that detail
 the fiscal and military obligations of those settled on the island have received
 attention in the scholarship, surely the most controversial passage lies at the
 end of line 1, and it is here that the identity of the settlers was articulated
 in this no-longer extant portion of the decree. The new fragment published by
 Matthaiou confirms the accusative plural -os
 ending, but does not resolve whether the settlers were referred to as 
 clerouchs
  or as Athenian citizens.
 Cleruchies
  were a phenomenon mostly of 5th and 4th century
 Athens, and in simplest terms amounted to a
 community of Athenian colonists inhabiting territory outside of Attica with all of the rights and obligations of
 Athenian citizens (Graham 1983, 167ff.; the scholiast to Pindar 2.19 refers to Timodemos, of the Attic deme of Acharnai but a clerouch on Salamis). With the exception of the cleruchy at Chalcis in the aftermath of the conflict with
 Athens in 506 BCE (where Herodotus refers to the settlement of 4000
 Athenians on the land of well-to-do Chalcidians: Hdt. 5.77.2, 6.100.1), and Salamis—if the restoration is
 correct—Athens dispatched no
 other cleruchs until the middle of the 5th century (for a list of the cleruchies
 ca. 450 BCE, see OCD s.v. ‘cleruchy’). The
 restoration of klero/xos supports the
 interpretation that an Athenian cleruchy on Salamis following on the heels of the Chalcidian settlement would serve as a none-too-subtle
 challenge to the authority of the Peloponnesian League in the Saronic Gulf
 (Taylor 1997, 13-15, who with Luria suggests a date as early as 510-508 BCE).
 These cleruchs on Salamis will have joined
 other resident non-native citizens who held deme membership back in Attica but lived on the island. Thus, Cleisthenes’ political
 reorganization of Athens and Attica may well have included efforts to create
 nearby pockets of Athenian citizens who
 could promote Athens’ political
 agenda, even on the doorstep of her allies and rivals in the Saronic Gulf and Chalcis. Parent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Michael Arnush.
