Pausanias was an author of the most extensive surviving work of travel literature, the Description of Greece (Περιήγησις τῆς Ἑλλάδος). This work describes the cities and temples of a portion of much of Greece: Attica, Megara, Argos, Laconia, Messenia, Elis, Olympia, Achaea, Arcadia, Boeotia, Phocis, and Delphi. Pausanias was especially interested in the monuments, particularly those dating from the 5th, 4th, and 3rd centuries BCE. His descriptions give us evidence for many buildings and works of art that did not survive to the present day. Modern archaeological excavations have found ancient ruins that match his descriptions well, so, despite some points of confusion or inconsistency in his account, Pausanias is seen as a relatively reliable source for the sights of classical Greece. Pausanias tells stories to accompany his descriptions of buildings and monuments, which are themselves valuable, if somewhat arbitrary, pieces of evidence.
