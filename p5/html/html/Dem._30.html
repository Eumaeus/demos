<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>Dem. 30A TEI ProjectDem. 30Table of contents1. Dem. 301. Dem. 30(Demosthenes, Against Onetor I; see also Oratory). After Demosthenes won his suit against Aphobus (see Dem. 27, Dem. 28, Dem. 29), Aphobus was condemned to pay 10 talents in damages (see Money). But he managed to place most of his property out of the reach of Demosthenes or the courts, and move himself to Megara. He did own a farm in Athens, which Demosthenes tried to seize as part of the settlement (the farm was worth one talent). But Aphobus’ brother-in-law, Onetor, was living on the farm, and claimed that the farm was mortgaged to him. This speech is from a ‘suit for ejectment’ (δίκη ἐξούλης), by which Demosthenes tried to remove Onetor from the farm and to take possession of the farm himself. Dem. 30, the present speech, was the first speech Demosthenes gave at the trial. Dem. 31 was the speech Demosthenes gave in response to Onetor’s defense.
