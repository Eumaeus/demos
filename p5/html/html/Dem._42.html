Traditionally, this speech has been included among the speeches of Demosthenes. However, Libanius (a scholar of the fourth century CE), in his hypothesis (or summary) of this speech, expresses doubt as to who really wrote it (but summarizes it along with Demosthenes’ speeches anyway): This speech is not attributed by anyone to Demosthenes, but here is its summary. (ὁ μὲν λόγος οὐκ ἀναφέρεται παρά τινων ἐις τὸν Δημοσθένην, ὑπόθεσιν δὲ ἔχει ταύτην) (Libanius, Hypothesis to the Speech Against Phaenippus). The speech itself is one composed for a plaintiff (whose name we do not know) who is suing Phaenippus in order to make him perform certain ‘liturgies’, (λειτουργίαι) or public duties, that the plaintiff is unable to fulfill. It appears that both Phaenippus and the plaintiff are important and wealthy men in the city of Athens. During the year before the trial their fortunes take very different turns. The plaintiff lost 3 talents (see also Money) in a mining investment when the city repossessed the mines. On the other hand, Phaenippus acquired two very lucrative farming properties, one from his father Callippus and the other from his adoptive father, the orator Philostratus. Because of his reverses, the plaintiff claimed to be too poor to perform the liturgy that had been assigned him. Athenian law provided options in this situation. He had the right to nominate someone else who was financially able to take his place. If that person claimed to be too poor, the one originally assigned the liturgy could ask that the two of them exchange property. This exchange was called the ‘antidosis’ (ἀντιδόσις). The procedures of the antidosis were as follows. The generals (οἱ στρατηγοί) (Dem. 42.5) appointed a court date at which the plaintiff cited Phaenippus for the exchange of property. Before the trial, each party completed an exact inventory of all property owned subject to an inspection by the other party. At this point, according to the plaintiff, Phaenippus stated that there were no outstanding debts that he owed and he allowed the plaintiff to tour his extensive and prosperous lands, complete with wine and grain production and a timber industry. But, by the time that the trial arrived, mortgage-pillars appeared on Phaenippus’ land and Phaenippus had ‘discovered’ almost three talents of debt that he owed to various parties. Furthermore, two full storerooms of grain had gone missing from Phaenippus’ property. All of this was very disturbing to the plaintiff who merely wanted the property to which he was entitled under the provisions of the law. During the trial, the plaintiff produced much evidence which disproved Phaenippus’ claims of financial obligations and showed, rather, that Phaenippus led a profligate lifestyle, spending all of his money on fast chariots (Dem. 42.24) without any regard for the public good. We have no way of dating this speech more precisely than the fourth century BCE.Christopher CottenParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher Cotten.
