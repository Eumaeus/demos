This speech was written by Demosthenes on behalf of the son of the plaintiff, Aristodemus. The son is representing his father in the suit that the father has brought against Leochares. The case involves a dispute over the inheritance of the estate of a certain Archiades. Aristodemus, the great-grandnephew of Archiades is suing Leochares, the great-great-grandnephew of Archiades, who, through a series of three posthumous adoptions, is attempting to have himself declared the legally adopted son of Archiades. Archiades, who left no heirs, was survived by two male relatives: a brother, Meidylides, and the grandson of his sister Archidice, whose name was Leocrates. According to Athenian law, the brother, Meidylides, was designated the heir, being more closely related than Leocrates, who was the grandson of a sister (Dem. 44.2). However, at the time of Archiades’ death, Meidylides was out of the country. Leocrates, through posthumous adoption (see also Dem. 43 for another such instance), had himself declared the adopted son of Archiades and assumed control of the estate. Meidylides, upon his return to the city, was persuaded not to pursue justice on his own behalf but rather to consent to the circumstances. He and his grandson Aristodemus (the plaintiff in this case) remained passive while the family of Leocrates continued to hold on to the estate of Archiades. Leocrates transferred the clan and deme membership of his son Leostratus to that of Archiades, thus giving Leostratus the legal status of an adopted son of Archiades. Leostratus, in turn, did the same for his son Leocrates (who was named after his grandfather). Leocrates, the grandson, died without heirs, at which time Aristodemus stepped forward to claim the estate as the nearest of kin to the deceased Archiades. However, Leostratus sought to prevent the estate from passing out of his family by attempting to have his younger son, Leochares, declared to be the adopted son of Archiades. In order to counter this action, Aristodemus brought Leochares into court by filing an affidavit of objections (διαμαρτυρία) (Dem. 44.1; also Dem. 44.5). During the trial, the speaker argues that, by lineage, Aristodemus is much more closely related to Archiades than is Leochares, who is only the great-great-grandson of Archiades’ sister. Furthermore, the speaker states that Leochares’ ‘adoption’ as Archiades’ son, which only took place after the suit had been filed by Aristodemus, could only originate from dishonest motives.
