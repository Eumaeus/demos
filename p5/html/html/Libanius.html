An ancient scholar from Antioch who was one of the most renowned literary figures of late antiquity. Of his works, 64 speeches survive, which deal with questions of government and education. As a teacher of rhetoric, his educational works—in addition to the speeches, we have 1600 of his letters and 51 of his school exercises—are interested in purity of language and detailed questions of literary, oratorical style. Libanius also wrote ‘hypotheses’ or summaries, of all of Demosthenes’ orations; these are interesting in their own right, and often provide useful information regarding questions of authorship (did Demosthenes really write a particular speech?) and date (see also Oratory). It is important to remember, when using Libanius as a source for anything to do with classical Athenian democracy, that he lived seven hundred years after the fact; even though he is ‘ancient’, he was not at all close to the events themselves.
