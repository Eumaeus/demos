 Dem. 45
 1. Dem. 45Demosthenes, Against Stephanus (I), see also Oratory. This is a speech on behalf of Apollodorus in
 a perjury suit that he has brought against Stephanus. It is the
 first of two speeches delivered during this same trial (see also Dem. 46). Stephanus was a friend of Phormio (the same Phormio of Dem. 36) who testified on Phormio’s behalf
 in the special plea (παραγραφή) at the centre of that
 trial. The speeches Dem. 36,
 Dem. 45 (this speech), and
 Dem. 46 all concern the
 estate of Pasion, an Athenian banker. According to Pasion’s will, Phormio, a
 former slave of Pasion, was given Pasion’s widow in marriage as well as control over Pasion’s business affairs until Pasion’s younger son, Pasicles, came of age.
 This arrangement did not work because Apollodorus’
 (the older son of Pasion) was constantly spending money from
 the common family fund. To correct this problem, and to ensure that young Pasicles would be left with an inheritance when he came of age,
 Phormio elected to distribute all of Pasion’s property equally between the two sons. This did not satisfy
 Apollodorus, who then sued Phormio
 for 3000 drachmas (see also Money). He claimed that Phormio had withheld that sum of money when the property was
 distributed; the matter was submitted to arbitration and was it was decided that Phormio did indeed owe the money, which he then paid (Dem.
 36.3; Dem. 36.14-15). Twenty years passed, and
 Apollodorus decided that Phormio
 had defrauded him of 20 talents in bank-stock. Phormio, on the
 other hand, asserted that this was preposterous and filed a special plea to have this new
 suit dismissed, which is the direct concern of Dem. 36. In that speech, Phormio asserts
 that, since twenty years have passed, the statue of limitations (τὸν τῆς προθεσμίας νόμον) (Dem. 36.26) had expired and that Apollodorus had released him from any further financial obligations
 after he paid the 3000 drachmas. We learn in the present speech (Dem.
 45.1) that Apollodorus suffered an embarrassing defeat
 in the previous case because, he claims, he has been overwhelmed by false testimony (Dem. 45.1; see also Dem. 45.6). Apollodorus now claims that the testimony of Phormio’s witnesses (specifically Stephanus)
 was false and that several of the documents produced by Phormio
 (the will of Pasion, Phormio’s lease of Pasion’s
 property, and Apollodorus’ statement releasing Phormio of further financial responsibility) were forged and should
 not be credited as evidence. Apollodorus further states that
 Stephanus has merely sided with Phormio because of possible monetary gain and that he has ignored a distant
 family tie to Apollodorus (Dem. 45.53-54) which,
 according to Apollodorus’ notions of proper social
 practice (Dem. 45.65), would require that he support Apollodorus. Finally, he closes his speech with an attack on the character of
 Phormio, ridiculing his barbarian background and accusing him
 of carrying on an adulterous relationship with Archippe, Apollodorus’ mother, which resulted in the birth of Pasicles, Apollodorus’ younger
 brother (Dem. 45.72-74; also Dem.
 45.83-84). The speech closely resembles genuine works of Demosthenes stylistically. However, its authorship is
 disputed on the grounds that it would be strange (and perhaps unethical) for Demosthenes to write a speech in defence of Phormio (Dem.
 36) and then turn to write a speech (Dem. 45) attacking Phormio in the harshest
 terms. Plutarch expressly states that Demosthenes did
 write the speech (Plut. Dem. 15) . Aeschines, a bitter political rival of Demosthenes, does accuse him of accepting money from Phormio to write a speech and then revealing its contents to Apollodorus (Aeschin. 2.165; Aeschin. 3.173).
 However, were it known that Demosthenes had indeed
 written a speech for Apollodorus, we would expect Aeschines to mention it. We know that Pasion’s death is placed at 370 BCE (source
 for date: OCD

 ) and that the lawsuit that Dem. 36 is concerned with takes place about 20 years later, around 350 BCE. The present speech can be said to have taken place sometime
 after that.Christopher CottenParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher Cotten.
