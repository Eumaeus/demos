SummaryThe Cleisthenic reforms of 508/7, which firmly established democracy at Athens, imposed a new division of Attica into ten tribes, each of which constituted a new political and
 military unit, but included citizens from each of the three geographical regions of
 Attica—the city, the coast, and the
 inland. Enrollment in a tribe (according to heredity) was a mandatory prerequisite for
 citizenship.As usual in ancient Athenian affairs, politics and religion came hand in hand and, after
 due consultation with Apollo’s oracle at Delphi, each new tribe was assigned to a particular hero after
 whom the tribe was named; the ten tribal heroes are thus known as the eponymous (or name
 giving) heroes.2. The tribal heroes as a group: historyAristotle indicates that each hero already received
 worship by the time of the Cleisthenic reforms,
 although little evidence as to the nature of the worship of each hero is now known (Aristot. Ath. Pol. 21.6).
 Even if the locus of their individual cults is obscure, each hero may be identified,
 according to his mythology, with a particular part of Attica (e.g. Ajax of Salamis). Tribal documents seem to have been deposited at the local shrine
 of each hero, as well as by the statue of the relevant hero in the Monument of the Eponymous Heroes at the Agora in Athens.The concept of an eponymous hero was an established tradition before the reforms of Cleisthenes; the four Ionian tribes, for example, were said by
 Herodotus to have been named after the sons of Ion (Hdt.
 5.66). And the reverence of a hero whose name might be similar or identical to
 the name of the place where s/he was worshipped is an ancient mode of thought that by the
 classical period comes quite close to the concept of personification—the
 representation of a thing, place, or abstraction as a person or by the human
 form—so that in many cases it is impossible to determine whether the hero was
 named for the place or vice versa. Either way, however, through the
 democratic era, each eponymous hero came to be so closely identified with his tribe that
 his figure served to represent that group of people in a political sense. In the Agora—the market and political center of
 Athens—the heroes were commemorated (and
 worshipped?) together at the Monument of the Eponymous Heroes, attested as early as Aristoph. Peace 1183, but
 enshrined in its current form—east of the Metroon on the west side of the Agora—in the 340s or 330s.3. The tribal heroes as a group: mythologyJust as politics and religion were inextricably entwined at Athens, so were myth and history, which together served to support
 political and/or religious institutions. So it is no surprise that in a funeral oration
 Ps.-Dem. 60.27ff chooses first to
 praise the heroism of the deceased and then to connect some small fragment from the
 mythology of each tribal hero with the courage and patriotism of the fallen warriors. Thus
 the frequent appearance of the heroes—individually and particularly
 together—in mythological contexts dating to the era of the Democracy (from 508 down to 322)—whether as tragic characters
 on the stage or figures ornamenting vases may be considered politically motivated. Just as
 personifications symbolize places, institutions, and abstractions, the roles of the
 eponymous heroes in visual as well as the literary arts—whether or not in
 mythological contexts—is as symbols of the tribes with which they shared their
 names. Whether to patriotic tribesmen or to (dis)interested others, they advertise their
 tribes. It is unsurprising, therefore, that the heroes are always shown in a good light in
 Athenian visual arts.4. The individual heroes: AjaxAjax (tribe: 
 Aiantis
 )Mythology: Ajax, son of Telamon and of
 (P)eriboia, is attested as a hero from Salamis as early as Homer
 (Hom. Il. 2.257,
 7.199; Hdt. 5.66). His genealogy is further
 discussed by archaic and classical authors (Xen. Hunt. 1.9, Paus. 1.42.4, and Pind.
 I. 6.45), as are his offspring (Soph. Aj. 574-575;
 Plut. Sol. 10; Hdt. 6.35.4), and his role as a
 warrior at Troy (Hom. Il. 2.557; Soph. Aj. 861; Hom. Od.
 11.543-60; Hdt. 8.64). Worship: Ajax was worshipped primarily at his home, Salamis (Paus. 1.35.3-4 notes a temple
 with an ebony statue) but also at Athens proper
 (probably in the Eurysakeion in Melite, for which see Hesperia 7 [1938] 18, 94 no. 15; this may be the sanctuary
 recorded in two inscriptions: Agora I 286 and IG
 II2, 1008.87). Pausanias
 also mentions a Megarian cult of Athena Aiantis (Paus.
 1.42.4)5. The individual heroes: AigeusAigeus (tribe: 
 Aigeis
 )Mythology: Aigeus was said to be the son of Pandion or Skyrios (Apollod. 3.15.5), or perhaps was
 adopted by Pandion (Plut. Thes. 13.1) and,
 despite several marriages (to Meta [Melite?] and Chalkiope), remained childless until he
 slept with Aithra (who subsequently bore Theseus) at Troizen (Apollod. 3.15.7; Plut. Thes. 3.5). He later
 married Medea (Eur. Med. 1384 ff.; Apollod.
 Epit. 1.5; Paus.
 2.3.8), then was reunited with his son, Theseus (Plut. Thes. 12.2-6),
 and leapt to his death by jumping off the Acropolis when he saw black sails on Theseus’ ship (Paus.
 1.22.5; Diod. 4.61.7). Worship: Aigeus received a heroon (that is, a
 hero-shrine) at Athens, according to Paus. 1.22.5 (supported by Harpocration s.v.
 ‘Aigeion’); this may have been at the Delphinion, where he was said to live (Plut. Thes. 12.6), or the
 Sanctuary of Aphrodite
 Ourania, which he founded on account of his childlessness,
 according to Paus. 1.14.7.Tribal connection: The only tribal detail relevant to Aigeus
 that is known to have been recorded is that Aigeus’
 priest was chosen from among the tribesman of the Aigeis tribe (IG II2, 952). 6. The individual heroes: AkamasAkamas (tribe: 
 Akamantis
 )Mythology: Akamas was a son of Theseus,
 and brother of Demophon (Ilias Parva fr.
 17 Kinkel, Iliupersis fr. 3 K). His maternity was
 disputed, however (his mother is said to be Phaidra [Diod. 4.62; Apollod. Epit. 1.18], Ariadne
 [Schol. Hom. Od. 11.321], or Antiope, by association). He is associated with colonisations in
 the Chersonnese (with Antimachos: Sch. Thuc. 1.11), at
 Cyprus (Strab. 6.83; with Phaleros: Lycophron 494
 ff.).Worship: Akamas’ tribal shrine was at Kallithea (Xypete or
 Alopeke): see Athens, EM
 13354/Athens, EM 13354a (ca. 361/0). He was also worshipped with his siblings (children of Theseus) at Phaleron (Paus. 1.1.4) and at Dipylon, with Zeus Orkeios and Hermes (IG II2,
 4983).Tribal connection: A fragmentary inscription, Agora XV 128
 (IG II2, 917; published in Hesperia 9 [1940] 116), may record a tribal
 priesthood.7. The individual heroes: AntiochosAntiochos (tribe: 
 Antiochis
 )Mythology: Antiochos was a son of Herakles
 (Ps.-Dem. 60.31; Apollod. 1.8.3) and Meda (Paus. 1.5.2). The descendants of his
 son Phylas led the return of the Heracleidae (according to Paus.
 2.4.3; Apollod. 1.8.3; Diod. 4.37), and he had strong ties to
 Corinth and Boeotia. His only mythological connection with Attica is attested in his appearance on vase imagery, particularly among
 the boys sent to the Minotaur (see the Francois Vase [Florence
 4209]).Worship: Antiochos, son of Herakles, was worshipped appropriately at the Herakleion in Kynosarges (published by
 C. Karouzos in ArchDelt 8 [1923] 82-102);
 some fourth century tribal decrees found there refer
 to a priest of Antiochos); it is highly likely, however, that
 Antiochos’ cult came to Kynosarges after the Cleisthenic reforms
 of 508/7, and his cult is not mentioned in Pausanias’ discussion of the Herakleion there (Paus. 1.19.3).Tribal connection: A member of the Antiochis
 tribe held the priesthood of Antiochos at Kynosarges, according to an inscription dated 169/8 (see Dow 1937,
 71).8. The individual heroes: ErechtheusErechtheus (tribe: 
 Erechtheis
 )Mythology: Erechtheus, who is often confused (in ancient as in
 modern discussions) with Erichthonios, was born from the Earth
 (Hom. Il.
 2.546-51; Hdt. 8.55; Soph. Aj. 202 [Erichthonios]). His mother is sometimes reported to have been Nemesis at Rhamnous, where he
 was king, and where he founded her temple (Suda s.v.
 ‘Ramnousia Nemesis’ (rho,33)). The Parian Marble (Marm. Par. 28 ff.)
 records that he was the son of Pandion and Zeuxippe, and twin brother of Boutes, who became
 priest when Erechtheus became King of Athens (Apollod.
 3.14.8). His marriage to Praxithea is recorded in
 Eur. Erech. His sons Kekrops II, Pandoros, and Metion, are mentioned by Apollod. 3.15.1, and he had many daughters—Kreousa, Prokris (by whom he fathered Aglauros, according to Hyg. Fab. 253), Chthonia, Oreithyia, and Hyakinthides. When he fought against Eleusis (Eur. Erech.; Thuc. 2.15.1) he gained victory by
 voluntarily sacrificing his daughters. His killing of Eumolpos
 (Apollod. 3.15.4) was avenged by
 Poseidon’s trident (Eur. Erech. fr. 65.90, 92?;
 Eur. Ion
 281-282) or by Zeus’ thunderbolt, at the request
 of Poseidon (Hyg.
 Fab. 46; see G.W. Elderkin,
 Hesperia 10 [1941] 113).Worship: Erechtheus was worshipped at the Erechtheion, which is thought to have been part of the Temple of Athena Polias (Paus. 1.26.5) or perhaps within the
 building known now as the Erechtheion (see K. Jeppesen, The Theory of the Alternative Erechtheion [Aarhus 1987]). Many sources
 confirm that he was worshipped on the Acropolis (Hdt. 8.55;
 Eur. Erech. fr. 65.90-4
 Austin; IG I2, 580) and Hom. Il. 2.546-51
 attests that he was worshipped in the chief temple of Athena.
 (Hdt. 5.82 mentions also that he
 was worshipped in close connection with Athena Polias, perhaps at
 the Panathenaia).Erechtheus received worshipped also at Marathon (according to Nonnus
 39.210-13 or at Rhamnous, in the Temple of Nemesis (which he erected: Suda s.v.
 ‘Ramnousia Nemesis’ (rho,33)).Erechtheus may have shared worship with Poseidon (according to Paus.
 1.26.5 the two shared an altar as dictated by an oracle); he is referred to as
 Poseidon Erechtheus in Eur.
 Erech. fr. 65.93-94, and IG
 I2, 580 (see C. Austin,
 Recherches de Papyrologie 4 [1967] 59-60), although
 IG II2, 1146 indicates that their cults
 were separate). For Erechtheus’ connection with the
 Eteoboutadai (family of priests) see Plut. Mor. 841b, 843a-843c; Harpoc. s.v.
 ‘Eteoboutadai’.9. The individual heroes: HippothoonHippothoon (tribe: 
 Hippothontis
 )Mythology: Hippothoon was mentioned along with Eumolpos and Dolichos as an Eleusinian hero in Hes. fr. 227 M-W (and
 is shown at the mission of Triptolemos on vases). He was the
 son of Poseidon and Alope (Hellanicus FGrH 323a F 6; Hyg. Fab. 187; Paus. 1.39.3); his birth and
 mother’s subsequent death appeared in several tragedies (Eur. Alope; Choirilos
 Alope; cf. Aristoph. Birds 559). According to Hyg. Fab. 187, Hippothoon received Theseus into his
 ancestral lands after he had killed Kerkyon.Worship: Hippothoon was worshipped at Eleusis, according to honorary decrees dating to the fourth century (IG II2, 1149,
 1153), and a heroon of Hippothoon is attested (Paus. 1.38.4; IG
 II2, 1163).Tribal connection: Hippothoon’s priests were
 connected with the Eleusinian Mysteries (see,
 e.g. Palermo V 779 [ARV2, 496.5]), and were dictated by heredity
 rather than chosen from among the tribe (Agora 15, 132 and 261).10. The individual heroes: KekropsKekrops (tribe: 
 Kekropis
 )Mythology: Kekrops, who was half man and half snake (Aristoph. Wasps 438; Eur. Ion. 1163-1164; see also Berlin F 2357), has no recorded parentage; his autochthonous nature,
 noted by Apollod. 3.14.1,
 encouraged Athenian pride in their sense of belonging to Attica. He was an early King of Attica,
 either the first (Marm. Par. A 1) or successor to Aktaios (Paus.
 1.2.6). With Agraulos, daughter of Aktaios, he had three daughters, Aglauros, Pandrosos and Herse (Eur. Ion 270-272; Philochorus
 FGrH 328 F 106) and a son, Erysichthon (Apollod.
 3.14.1; Paus. 1.2.6).
 Kekrops is said to have introduced several cults, including
 the cult of Kronos and Rhea to Attica (Philochorus FGrH 328 F 97),
 as well as non-animal sacrifice to Zeus Hypatos (Paus. 8.2.3). He is also credited with
 introducing customs (Aristoph.
 Pl. 773) and writing (Tac. Ann. 11.14), and
 even presided over the contest between Athena and Poseidon for the patronage of Athens (Xen. Mem. 35.10; Apollod. 3.14.1 suggests
 otherwise).Worship: Kekrops was worshipped on the Acropolis (IG II2,
 1156), perhaps in a cave (Eur.
 Ion 1400), a tomb (Clem. Alex.
 Protr. 3.45), or a corner near the south wall of the Erechtheion (IG
 I3, 474.59-63); here his priesthood was hereditary among the
 Amynandridai (IG II2,
 2388). By the time of Hadrian times Kekrops was also worshipped in the Thriasian Plain. Kekrops may also
 have received worship outside Attica: in Haliartos (Paus. 9.33.1) and in Megara (Hsych.
 s.v.
 ‘
 En d’Aithuia
 ’).11. The individual heroes: LeosLeos (tribe: 
 Leontis
 )Mythology: Although another Attic hero (Leos the herald; see
 Plut. Thes. 13) is
 known by this name, Leos the eponymous hero has no mythology
 aside from a mention that he is the son of Orpheus (Bekk.
 Anecd. 1.277.14), the father of Kylanthos (Suda, Phot.
 s.v.
 ‘Leokorion’ [lambda,262; see also lambda,261), and three
 daughters—Euboule, Phrasithea or Praxithea, Theope or Theopompe—who sacrificed
 themselves to save Attica (Ps.-Dem. 60.29; Ael. VH 12.28; Diod. 17.15).Worship: Leos was worshipped in the deme Skambonidai (IG I3,
 244.C4-5) and perhaps in the Agora at
 the Leokoreion (discussed by S. Rotroff, Hesperia 47 [1978] 206-207).Tribal connection: The priest of Leos was chosen from among
 members of the Leontis tribe in 212/1 (IG II2, 847.51-52 = Dow 1937,
 36). Tribal documents have been found on the Acropolis (IG II2,
 1742) and at Daphni (IG II2, 2818), as well as in the Agora (Hesperia 9 [1941] 59-66 no.
 8).12. The individual heroes: OineusOineus (tribe: 
 Oineis
 )Mythology: Oineus was a son of Dionysos
 (Ps.-Dem. 60.30) or an illegitimate
 son of Pandion (Paus. 1.5.2).Worship: No evidence attests Oineus’ individual
 worship or details of his tribal affiliation.13. The individual heroes: PandionPandion (tribe: 
 Pandionis
 )Mythology: There were at least two Attic kings named Pandion. The
 first, successor and son of Erichthonios (Marm. Par. A 11) and Praxithea (Apollod.
 3.14.6) was husband to Zeuxippe, with whom he fathered
 Erechtheus (Marm.
 Par. A 15), Boutes, Prokne, and Philomela (Apollod. 3.14.8; for Prokne see Hes.
 WD. 568; Sappho 86D; and Palermo 12480 [ARV2 1249.21]; for Philomela see also Hes.
 WD 566 [in Hom.
 Od. 18.518 she is daughter of Pandareos]). The second, son of Kekrops II (Marm. Par. A 17) and Metiadousa (Apollod.
 3.15.5; Paus. 9.33.1) was
 expelled by Metion to Megara, where he married a daughter of King Pylas (Apollod 3.15.5;
 Paus. 1.5.3), and fathered Lykos, Pallas, Nisos, and Aigeus (FGrH 329 F 2; Soph.
 TGrF 4.24). Pandion is elsewhere
 mentioned as father of Teithras (Sch. Aristoph. Frogs
 477) and Kephalos (Hyg. Fab. 270) and is
 credited with instituting the form of the Choes (Sch. Aristoph. Ach. 961;
 Aristoph. Kn.
 95).Worship: Pandion was worshipped by the fourth century on the Acropolis (IG II2, 1138, 1144, 1157; Paus. 1.5.4). Pandion may have been worshipped at Plotheia, where games in his honor (?), the Pandia, were celebrated (IG
 I3, 258.9); he probably also received a sacrifice as founder
 of the Pandia (Kearns
 1989, 81). Pandion received worship outside Attica, at his tomb in the cave Sanctuary of Athena Aithyia in Megara. He also received a
 monument in Megara (Paus. 1.5.3, 1.39.4, and Paus. 1.41.6).G.P. Stevens has identified a Monument of Pandion in the Agora (see the line
 drawing above).14. Images of the heroes: sculptureStatuesMarathon victory group by Pheidias at Delphi (with Athena, Apollo, and Miltiades), ca. 460-450: Paus. 10.10.1 (Erechtheus, Kekrops, Pandion, Leos, Antiochos, Aigeus, and Akamas).Battle group of Erechtheus and Eumolpos, by Myron, ca. 460-450, on the Akropolis at

 attested by physical evidence may be dated to ca. 330. At
 this time it constituted a long limestone statue base which carried ten bronze
 statues—one of each of the heroes, and tripods at each end (probably in
 commemoration of the fact that the Delphic oracle was consulted for the choice of the
 heroes). The entire base was surrounded by a barrier of fence posts (some marble and
 limestone posts remain), with wooden railings. This monument served as a public notice
 board for tribal affairs, general notices for the Assembly, and the heroes may also have received worship there.Statue of Pandion on the Akropolis at Athens:
