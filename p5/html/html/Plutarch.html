He is most famous for his works of biography. Plutarch was an extremely prolific writer—we know the titles of 227 works by him, of which 128 survive. His works fall into two categories. The first are the so-called Moralia, 78 works on subjects of morality, with titles such as Friends and Flatterers, Rules for Politicians, or God’ Slowness to Punish. The second category, the works most useful to the study of political history, are the Parallel Lives. These are 23 pairs of biographical sketches, a famous Greek person matched with a famous Roman; 19 of these pairs also includes an essay comparing the two. For example, Plutarch pairs a biography of the Greek orator Demosthenes with a biography of the Roman orator Cicero; he pairs Alexander the Great with Julius Caesar, and the (mythical) Roman king Romulus with the (mythical) Athenian king Theseus. These biographies generally follow a pattern: the subject’s family, his education, his entry into public life, the high points of his career, a change in fortune or attitude, and his final years and death. At the beginning of his Life of Alexander (Plut. Alex. 1) Plutarch says, explicitly, that his purpose is not to write political history, but to bring out the subject’s particular virtues and vices and to illustrate his character. This purpose is worth bearing in mind—Plutarch’s lives are not necessarily objective historical accounts, but narrative pictures aiming to convey a particular moral point.
