This is a speech written by Dinarchus for client (whose name we do not know) prosecuting Philocles in a case involving bribery. In 324 BCE, Harpalus, who was Alexander the Great's treasurer, fled from Babylon and came to Athens with a large amount of Alexander's money. He was admitted into the city, taken into custody with the money, but later escaped. Afterwards, it was found that several hundred talents was missing from the money he had brought to the city (see Money). The Areopagus investigated the matter, and issued a report, or apophasis (ἄποφασις), saying that certain Athenians had accepted bribes from Harpalus. The orator Demosthenes was named in the report (see Din. 1. According to the Third Letter of Demosthenes, a work whose authenticity is doubtful, Philocles was convicted.
