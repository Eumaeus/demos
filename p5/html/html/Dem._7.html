<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>Dem. 7A TEI ProjectDem. 7Table of contents1. Dem. 71. Dem. 7(Demosthenes, On Halonnesus, see also Oratory). This speech is somewhat controversial. The ancient commentator Dionysius of Halicarnassus calls it the Eighth Philippic (Dion. Hal. Ad Amm. 10.33; see also, Dem. 4, Dem. 6, Dem. 9, Dem. 10, the Philippics). But Libanius, another ancient commentator, says that this speech is not actually by Demosthenes, but by Hegesippus, based on its style and subject matter (Lib. Or. 7.6-8; unfortunately, no other speech by Hegesippus survive, so we cannot compare the styles for ourselves). The relevant texts from Dionysius and Libanius are given below. The background to the speech is this: Shortly after 346 BCE, Halonnesus, an island in the Aegean that belonged to Athens, was captured by a pirate named Sostratus. Philip of Macedon defeated this pirate and took over control of the island himself. In 343 BCE Athens sent an embassy to Philip to demand that he return Halonnesus to its rightful owner, Athens. One of the ambassadors from Athens was Hegesippus. Philip offered, not to return the island to Athens, but to give it as a gift. This speech, probably written by Demosthenes, but certainly not delivered by him — the speaker says that he was a member of the embassy to Philip, which Demosthenes was not (see Dem. 7.2) — was probably delivered before the Assembly in 342 BCE.On the subject of Dem. 7, Dionysius of Halicarnassus says (Dion. Hal. Ad Amm. 10.33): After Lykiskon was archon, Pythodotos was archon, in the year when the eighth of the speeches against Philip was composed, the beginning of which is ‘O men of Athens, there is no way that the charges…’ (compare Dem. 7.1) (μετὰ Λυκίσκον ἔστιν ἄρχων Πυθόδοτος, ἐφ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??οὗ ὀγδόην τῶν Φιλιππικῶν δημηγοριῶν διέθετο πρὸς τοὺς Φιλίππου πρέσβεις, ἧς ἐστιν ἀρχή Ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, οὐκ ἔστιν, ὅπως αἱ αἰτίαι…). But Libanius says (Lib. 7.6-7): Yes, by Zeus, but the speech on the Halonnesus advises the Athenians not to take it, but to take it back and it makes a distinction between the words, and regarding these matters, Aeschines says that Demosthenes advised the Athenians. Then what’s this? For it is possible for this advice to have been given by Demosthenes or Hegesippus, since in other respects they held the same view and they opposed those orators who were taking Philip's side, and Demosthenes mentions that Hegesippus, when he was an ambassador with Demosthenes and also opposed the Macedonian. And so it is clear that the speech that Demosthenes wrote regarding the Halonnesus does not survive, but with that speech not in existence, they attributed the one they found to him, having as an excuse the fact that the orator did give a speech on the Halonnesus, never examining closely whether, in fact, it seems likely to have been by him.
