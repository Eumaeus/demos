 Aeschines
 This article was originally written for the online discussion series ‘Athenian
 Law in its Democratic Context,’ organized by Adriaan Lanni and sponsored by
 Harvard University’s Center for Hellenic
 Studies.Aeschines son of Atrometus of the deme Cothocidae (390-ca. 322) was an actor before becoming a politician, for which he
 is repeatedly lampooned by Demosthenes. He served on the
 Athenian embassies to Philip regarding the ‘Peace of
 Philocrates;’ in the period which followed his
 support for the peace brought him into constant conflict with Demosthenes. Upon his return from the second embassy in 346 he was accused of taking Macedonian bribes by Demosthenes and his associate Timarchus. He
 counterattacked by prosecuting Timarchus for speaking in the
 Assembly after having prostituted himself, and won his
 case with the oration ‘Against
 Timarchus’ (1). When Demosthenes
 revived the allegations of bribery in 343, Aeschines defended himself with the speech ‘On the False Embassy’
 (2). He barely escaped conviction, and his influence was clearly on the wane.In spring 339, as an Athenian representative at the meeting of
 the Amphictyonic League, Aeschines successfully deflected the wrath of the League
 from Athens onto Amphissa. However, the Fourth Sacred War against Amphissa bore bitter fruit for the Athenians as well, as it brought Philip into central Greece and eventually led to the battle of
 Chaeroneia. In 336
 Aeschines indicted Ctesiphon
 for proposing the grant of a gold crown to Demosthenes.
 When the case came to trial six years later, Aeschines
 delivered his oration ‘Against
 Ctesiphon’ (3). Despite the legal merits of his case, he received
 less than twenty percent of the jury’s votes, and he left Athens to teach rhetoric on
 Rhodes. (See also Oratory.)David D. PhillipsParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback David D. Phillips.
