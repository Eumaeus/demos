In 340 BCE Philip of Macedon sent a letter to Athens complaining about Athenian acts of hostility toward him in the immediately preceding years (source for date: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 316). This letter arrived while Philip was besieging Perinthus, a coastal town in Thrace. Philip had also recently attacked Byzantium on the Black Sea, but that city, with help from Athens, resisted him. A text of the letter from Philip appears in Dem. 18, but that is widely thought to be a later forgery, rather than the actual text of the letter (source: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 316). Another version of the letter from Philip has been handed down in the body of Demosthenes ’ works—even though it is not, and does not claim to be, by Demosthenes, it is knows as Dem. 12. The present work, Dem. 11, claims to be represent Demosthenes ’ public response to Philip’s letter. Because it seems to consist mostly of sentences and phrases that appear in other speeches by Demosthenes, many scholars think that this is a forgery (source: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 317). Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
