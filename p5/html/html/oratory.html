Oratory There survives, from the late 5th century through the 4th century BCE, a large body of speeches that were given in public forums, either in the Assembly or in law-courts (speeches for the prosecution or defense in a civil or criminal trial). We have speeches from the orators Lysias, Isaeus, Hyperides, Isocrates, Dinarchus, Demades, Aeschines, Antiphon, Lycurgus, Andocides, and Demosthenes. These are important sources for Athenian Democracy, but must be treated with care; the speechwriters, like modern lawyers, wanted to win their cases, and so we should assume that they would twist the truth to their advantage whenever they could get away with it. Orators were out to win, not to write history.One clear example of the orators’ lack of interest in consistency, when it came to the historical ‘facts’ that they relate has to do with the Assembly’s granting of citizenship. Demosthenes says, in one speech, that Meno of Pharsalus and Perdiccas of Macedonia were granted citizenship by the Assembly (Dem. 23.199 - Dem. 23.200), but at another place he says, quite explicitly, that these two were not granted citizenship but merely immunity from taxes (Dem. 13.23 - Dem. 13.24).
Still, oratory gives us most of what we know about the day-to-day working of the Athenian Democracy. A final cautionary word is in order on laws quoted in oratory. When a speech quotes a ‘law’, it is very likely that the quotation was not part of the original speech, but was added later (sometimes much later); this means that these quotation are not necessarily as reliable as they might initially seem.
