IsaeusThis article was originally written for the online discussion series ‘Athenian Law in its Democratic Context,’ organized by Adriaan Lanni and sponsored by Harvard University’s Center for Hellenic Studies.Isaeus son of Diagoras (ca. 420-post 344/3) is one of the least well-known Attic orators. The ancients themselves could not agree on whether he was Athenian or Chalcidian by birth. A student of Isocrates, he worked as a speechwriter and also taught the art of rhetoric; his most famous student was Demosthenes. Isaeus’ specialty was inheritance law, a difficult and fruitful area of litigation even by Athenian standards ([Arist.] Ath. Pol. 9.2). The eleven speeches of Isaeus which survive entire (1-11) are all concerned, directly or indirectly, with inheritance disputes; the speech ‘For Euphiletus’ (12) deals with the restoration of citizenship.
