Megalopolis was a relatively new city in the area called Arcadia, in the Peloponnese. It had been founded in 371 BCE after Thebes defeated Sparta at the battle of Leuctra. The Thebans intended for Megalopolis to serve as a capital city of Arcadia, and to unite the region. They hoped that a united Arcadia would limit Spartaâ€™s power in the Peloponnese. But in 353 BCE, Thebes was occupied by a war against Phocis, in central Greece, and Sparta was free to assert control, once again, over the Peloponnese. The people of Megalopolis asked for Athens to become their ally. In this speech, Demosthenes argues before the Athenian Assembly in favor of an alliance with Megalopolis. The Athenians did not take his advice, but followed a policy of neutrality advocated by Eubulus. (Source for dates: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 437).
