Demosthenes’ father, who was also named Demosthenes, died when his son was seven and left a large estate in the hands of three trustees, Aphobus, Demophon, and Therippides. Aphobus was to marry the widow, Demosthenes’ mother, and receive 80 minae as a dowry (see Money). Demophon was to marry the young daughter, once she came to be old enough (she was only five when her father died); he was to receive a dowry of 2 talents at the time of the marriage. Therippides was to manage the estate, earning a salary for his work, until the younger Demosthenes came of age. But, it seems, these three men followed none of these instructions, but squandered the money, so that when young Demosthenes turned 17 only one tenth of the original estate remained. Demosthenes studied for two years under the orator Isaeus, and then initiated three lawsuits against the three trustees. The first one, against Aphobus, came to trial in 364 BCE. Dem. 27, the first speech against Aphobus, was Demosthenes’ initial prosecution of the trustee. Demosthenes won this case, and the jury ordered Aphobus to pay 10 talents in damages. But Demosthenes had difficulty collecting the damages from Aphobus. Two subsequent speeches, Dem. 28 and Dem. 29, were given by Demosthenes in his efforts to recover his money (see also Dem. 30 and Dem. 31, both against Onetor, a brother-in-law of Aphobus).
