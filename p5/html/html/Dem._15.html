Rhodes had been one of Athens’ allies before the so-called ‘Social War’, in which Rhodes, Cos, and Chios revolted against Athenian control. After the war ended, in 355 BCE, Mausolus the satrap (governer ruling on behalf of the Persian King) of Caria, intervened in Rhodian affairs and established a oligarchic government. The democratic party at Rhodes appealed to Athens to help. In this speech, probably delivered in 351 BCE, Demosthenes attempts to convince the Athenian Assembly to help reestablish democracy on Rhodes. The speech was unsuccessful, perhaps because the Athenians did not dare to risk a war with Caria and the Persians. (Source for dates: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 411). Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
