<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>Dem. 4A TEI ProjectDem. 4Table of contents1. Dem. 41. Dem. 4(Demosthenes, First Philippic, see also Oratory). This is a speech that Demosthenes gave at a meeting of the Assembly, and then published later. He delivered this speech sometime before 351 BCE (source for date: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 67). This speech represents the first time that Demosthenes spoke first in a debate in the Assembly (see Dem. 4.1). The subject of the speech is Philip of Macedon, who had been increasingly active in Greek affairs, particularly those of Thrace and Euboea. Macedonian ships had even captured some ships bringing food to Athens. Here, Demosthenes urges the Athenians not to feel helpless in the face of Philip’s strength, but to fight to protect Athenian interests (See also, Dem. 6, Dem. 9, Dem. 10—all speeches urging opposition to Philip).
