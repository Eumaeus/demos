<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>Dem. 3A TEI ProjectDem. 3Table of contents1. Dem. 31. Dem. 3(Demosthenes’ Third Olynthiac; see also Oratory). This is a speech written and delivered by Demosthenes, probably in the autumn of 349 BCE (source: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 2; the date is based on a statement from Philochorus). Demosthenes gave a version of this speech at a meeting of the Assembly, and then published it later. This is the third of Demosthenes’ speeches in which he tried to persuade the Athenians to help the city of Olynthus resist attack by Philip of Macedon. After Demosthenes’ First Olynthiac (Dem. 1), Athens sent an armed force, but did not fund it sufficiently. In his Second Olynthiac (Dem. 2) he argued that the Theoric fund be spent on the war. That proposal was evidently declared unconstitutional, because here Demosthenes argues for a revision of the law that would allow the Theoric fund to be used variously, in emergencies (see Dem. 1, Dem. 2).
