Ancient ScholarshipJust as modern scholars read and comment on the work of ancient historians, orators, and poets, so too did ancient scholars. Scholars like Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Libanius, or Didymus wrote commentaries on ancient authors and works. These ancient scholars addressed issues of style (What are the defining characteristics of Demosthenesâ€™ rhetorical style?) authorship (Did Demosthenes actually write the speech On Halonnesus?, see Dem. 7), or details of content (When Homer mentions a door-lock, what kind of door-lock is he describing?). While these ancient scholars were just as likely to make mistakes as modern scholars, they did have access to many works that have not survived to the present day. A significant work in this genre is the Suda, a historical encyclopedia from the 10th century CE, that provides many quotations from lost authors, discussions of word-usage, and historical anecdotes.Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W.
