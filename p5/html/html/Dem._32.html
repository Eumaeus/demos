Demosthenes wrote this speech for Demo (his uncle). Demo had been sued by Zenothemis, and this speech was delivered as part of the trial. We do not have any of the other speeches from this trial, so the following reconstruction of events is based on only one point of view. Demo had invested a large amount of money with Protus, who was a grain-merchant. Protus was supposed to take Demo’s money to Sicily, buy a shipment of grain with it, transport the grain back to Athens, and sell it. Demo would have a share in the profit and could expect to make a huge profit (of course, if the ship sank, he would lose all of his investment).Protus hired a ship that was owned by a man named Hegestratus. The ship sailed to Sicily with Protus and Hegestratus on board, and also a man named Zenothemis. When the ship reached Syracuse, a city in Sicily, Protus bought the grain and loaded it on board the ship.But Hegestratus and Zenothemis had devised a scheme between themselves: they persuaded people in Syracuse to invest in the shipment of grain, just as Demo had done. These investors thought that Hegestratus and Zenothemis would use their money to buy a load of grain. But since Demo had already paid for the grain, the two con-men could keep the money. In order to avoid getting caught, they planned to sink the ship once it was at sea, and escape in the lifeboat. They could tell their investors that the grain was lost, and their investment with it. Thus they would be free to keep all the money, and their investors would never learn that the cargo had belonged to someone else all along.When the ship was on its way back to Athens, Hegestratus tried to cut a hole in its bottom. He was caught in the act, however, jumped overboard to escape, and drowned.When the ship arrived in Athens, Protus and Demo (who owned the cargo of grain) went to unload the ship. But Zenothemis was also trying to unload the ship, claiming that the grain belonged to him. Protus and Demo prevented him from taking the grain, but Zenothemis sued them in court.Again, it is important to remember that we have only one side of this story. Zenothemis’ speeches in this trial might well have told a very different story. Two other speeches by Demosthenes have to do with investments in ships cargoes (often called ‘bottomry loans’ or ‘maritime loans’); see Dem. 34 and Dem. 35.Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W.
