Aeschines was an Athenian orator (see Oratory) who is most famous for his speeches in opposition to Demosthenes, beginning with a dispute over the outcome of an embassy to Philip of Macedon in 346 BCE. These exchanges provide us with much of what we know about the relationship between Athens and Macedonia during the middle of the 4th century; they are particularly valuable because they show us two sides of the issues of the day (cf. Dem. 18, Dem. 19, Aeschin. 2, Aeschin. 3). (See also the genre of Oratory.)Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
