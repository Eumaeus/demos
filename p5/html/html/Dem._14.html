In 354 BCE, a topic of debate in the Athenian Assembly was whether or not to go to war against Persia. Athens had recently settled a war, the so-called ‘Social War’, in which Rhodes, Cos, and Chios revolted against Athenian control. During this war, rumors came to Athens that Persia was making naval preparations. This news caused a great deal of concern, and led to talk of a Greek alliance, organized by Athens, waging war against Persia. This speech, Demosthenes’ first speech before the Assembly, argues against an immediate declaration of war, but proposes a program of military preparation. His particular suggestion was a reform of the trierarchy, the means by which individual Athenians (or small groups of citizens) undertook the maintance of a warship on the city’s behalf (see the article on Liturgies). Athens did not declare war on Persia, but did not adopt Demosthenes ’ suggestions either. (Source: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 380-81).
