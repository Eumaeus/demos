 Demosthenes
 384-322 BCE (source: OCD
 3
 ). Demosthenes was one of the most prolific
 orators of the 4th century BCE, and arguably the
 greatest (see Oratory). His earliest speeches
 are for plaintiffs or defendants in private lawsuits. From the year 355 (when he wrote speeches for the prosecution off the politically prominent
 men Androtion and Leptines
  [see Dem. 22, Dem. 20]), he became increasingly
 involved in the public business of the Athenian Democracy, writing and delivering speeches
 in trials with important political implications. After 351 many
 of Demosthenes’ speeches are on the subject of
 Athens’ policy toward Macedonia, concerning which he came into conflict with Aeschines on several notable occasions (cf. Dem. 18, Dem. 19, Aeschin. 2, Aeschin. 3). (See also the genre of Oratory.)Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W. Blackwell.
