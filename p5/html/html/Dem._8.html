The Chersonese is a large peninsula extending into the Aegean Sea from the north, in the territory of Thrace. Athens had been interested in this area since the late 6th century, because of its position on sailing route taken by ships bringing grain from the Black Sea to Athens. In the middle of the 4th century, when Cotys, the chief king of Thrace, died, the territory was divided between Amadocus and Cersobleptes, the son of Cotys. Philip of Macedon supported Amadocus, and the Athenians supported Cersobleptes. In the years before 346 BCE (the year of the ‘Peace of Philocrates’, see Dem. 18, Dem. 19, Aeschin. 2, Aeschin. 3) Philip and Amadocus had defeated Cersobleptes, who became a vassal of Philip. Sometime around 342, Athens send a general Diopithes to wage war in the Chersonese, who captured some territory under Philip's control. Philip retaliated, leading to a minor war in Thrace. In 341, Philip sent an embassy to Athens to complain of Athens' aggression. Demosthenes delivered this speech in the Assembly and succeeded in persuading his fellow citizens to continue to support their general Diopithes.
