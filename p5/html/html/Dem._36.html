 1. Dem. 36Demosthenes, For Phormio, see also Oratory. This speech was written by Demosthenes
 on behalf of Phormio, a former slave, who is being sued by his
 adopted son, Apollodorus. The occasion of the speech is Phormio’s special plea in bar of action (παραγραφή), in other words, a plea that the case not be tried
 before a jury (Dem. 36.2, also, Dem. 45.5; for pleas barring
 action, see People’s Court). This was in
 response to Apollodorus’ attempt to bring Phormio to trial to extract 20 talents (see also Money) that he claims that Phormio has
 fraudulently withheld from him. The history of the case can be traced back almost 20 years
 prior to this trial, from the death of Pasion, the former owner
 of Phormio. Pasion had placed great
 trust in Phormio, placing him in charge of his banking
 operations and his shield factory. Pasion’s will
 provided for Phormio to marry Pasion’s widow, to assume guardianship of Pasion’s ten-year-old son, Pasicles, and to
 retain control of the shield factory and bank until Pasicles
 came of age. But the interests of the young son were threatened by the actions of Pasion’s elder son, Apollodorus, who continually dipped into the common funds that Pasion had left his family (Dem. 36.8). Because the
 inheritance of the younger son was endangered, Phormio elected
 to distribute all of the property evenly. When Pasicles came of
 age, the bank was given over to Pasicles and the shield factory
 to Apollodorus, thus releasing Phormio of any further obligation. This, however, did not satisfy Apollodorus, who later took an opportunity to sue Phormio for three thousand drachmas which he claimed that Phormio had withheld out of Pasion’s property. This matter was referred to arbitration and the sum
 was paid by Phormio who was granted a new release from all
 obligations relating to the estate of Pasion (Dem.
 36.14-15). Now, twenty years later, Apollodorus is
 demanding more money from Phormio, in the sum of twenty talents
 worth of banking stock which he claims that Phormio
 fraudulently withheld (Dem. 36.4-7 and Dem. 36.11-13). Phormio entered a special plea in bar of action which is the
 subject of this particular case. His speech gives three reasons for doing so. First, Apollodorus is inordinately greedy and an uncontrolled spendthrift
 (Dem.
 36.41). Second, Phormio appeals to the fact that Apollodorus had released him from all obligations. And, third,
 since twenty years had passed, the statute of limitations had expired (τὸν τῆς προθεσμίας νόμον) (Dem. 36.26). We learn from
 Dem.
 45.6 that Phormio won this special plea
 overwhelmingly, with Apollodorus not even receiving one-fifth
 of the votes of the jury, and thus having to pay a fine for bringing a frivolous suit
 (τὴν ἐπωβελίαν; see Dem. 45.6). Pasion died in 370 BCE (source for date:

 ) and references in this speech (Dem. 36.19, Dem. 36.26, and Dem.
 36.38) allow it to be dated to about twenty years after the death of Pasion, to about 350 BCE (source for
 date: A.T. Murray, Demosthenes IV [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical
 Library; 1946] 321). The feud between Phormio and
 Apollodorus was carried on in another lawsuit; see Dem. 45.Christopher CottenParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher Cotten.
