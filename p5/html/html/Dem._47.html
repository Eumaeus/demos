 1. Dem. 47Demosthenes, Against Evergus and Mnesibulus, see also Oratory. While this speech comes down to us among
 the body of Demosthenes’ orations, it was
 probably written by Apollodorus on behalf of a plaintiff
 (whose name we do not know) in his suit against Evergus and
 Mnesibulus, whom the plaintiff charges with having given
 false testimony in a previous suit. This suit is the culmination of a long and somewhat
 complicated history of acrimony between the plaintiff and Theophemus. The tension began when the plaintiff assumed the duties of a
 trierarch (τριηραρξῶν), a liturgy (λειτουργία) (or service to the state) that was contracted out
 from time to time to wealthy citizens. The trierarch was responsible for outfitting a
 trireme (a warship) in the Athenian fleet, ensuring that the ship was ready for service
 when called upon. In performing his duties, the trierarch made use of equipment from the
 public stores, which had to be returned at the end of his period of service. Theophemus, who had served as trierarch prior to the plaintiff,
 ignored the request of the plaintiff for the return of the equipment. Upon his refusal,
 the plaintiff reported Theophemus’ refusal to the
 Council of the Five Hundred (τῆς
 βουλῆς τῶν πεντακοσίων) (Dem.
 47.18), who gave him official permission to use whatever means available to
 recover the property. When the plaintiff tried to seize other property of Theophemus as security, a fist-fight erupted (Dem. 47.38). As a result of this, the
 plaintiff brought Theophemus before the Council because of his non-compliance. The Council was prepared to inflict the highest possible fine (500 drachmas, Dem. 47.43; see also Money), but compromised at the last moment by assessing a fine of 25 drachmas
 and a promise of arbitration in the question of the fist fight. After a long stint at sea,
 the plaintiff returned and called arbitrators (διαιτητῶν) (Dem. 47.45)
 to settle the matter but Theophemus again refused to co-operate
 and brought a countersuit against the plaintiff in court. While the charges involved in
 Theophemus’ countersuit are not stated, we do know
 that he won a judgement against the plaintiff in the amount of 1100 drachmas and forcing
 the plaintiff to pay the fine for not receiving enough votes (ἐπωβολία) (Dem. 47.64).
 However, because of his duties as trierarch, the plaintiff was not immediately able to pay
 the judgement of 1100 drachmas and asked for more time. Later, when the plaintiff did
 attempt to pay the money, he was ignored by Theophemus, who
 went that same day to the plaintiff’s farm and seized property (50 sheep and
 some household slaves) greatly in excess of the 1100 drachmas that he was owed (Dem. 47.52-53). The next day, Theophemus accepted the plaintiff’s money but would not
 return the confiscated property unless the plaintiff would drop all charges against him
 and his friends, Evergus and Mnesibulus. The plaintiff refused this offer but on the very next day, after
 payment had already been made, Evergus returned to the
 plaintiff’s farm and seized additional property (some furniture) (Dem. 47.56). At this point, the plaintiff
 brought Evergus and Mnesibulus, two
 men who had served as witnesses on behalf of Theophemus, into
 court on charges of false testimony. This is the subject of the present trial. In his
 speech, the plaintiff charges that Evergus and Mnesibulus lied to the court about Theophemus’ role in the fist-fight. He also deplored the violence with
 which they had come to seize his property. In particular, the plaintiff mentions their
 rough treatment of his elderly nursemaid (Dem. 47.81). Because the speech mentions the archonship of Agathocles (356 BCE) (source for date: A.T.
 Murray, Demosthenes II [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930]
 303), this speech can be said to have taken place sometime after that date.Christopher CottenParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher Cotten.
