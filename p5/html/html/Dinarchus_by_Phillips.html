DeinarchusThis article was originally written for the online discussion series ‘Athenian Law in its Democratic Context,’ organized by Adriaan Lanni and sponsored by Harvard University’s Center for Hellenic Studies.Deinarchus son of Sostratus (ca. 360-post 292/1) was a metic from Corinth. After studying rhetoric under Theophrastus at the Lyceum, he enjoyed a long and successful career as a speechwriter. He composed speeches for one of the special prosecutors in the Harpalus affair, a scandal in which many prominent Athenians were prosecuted for corruption. His three surviving orations (1 ‘Against Demosthenes’, 2 ‘Against Aristogeiton’, 3 ‘Against Philocles’) come from these trials. The last (and, according to many critics, the least) of the canonical Attic orators, Deinarchus enjoyed the patronage of Demetrius of Phaleron during his decade in power (317-307). When Demetrius I Poliorcetes captured Athens in 307, Deinarchus fled to Chalcis, remaining there until Theophrastus arranged his homecoming in 292/1. Soon thereafter he brought suit against Proxenus, who hosted him upon his return; the subsequent fate of Deinarchus is unknown. (See also Oratory.)David D.
