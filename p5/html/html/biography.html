Biography Biography was not a clearly defined genre in antiquity; there were many authors who wrote works that we could call ‘biographical’, and these differ greatly from one another. Some focus on the upbringing of and early influences on historical figures, such as Xenophon’s Cyropaedia (The Education of Cyrus) (Xen. Cyrop. 1.1.1); others focus on political or military exploits, such as Arrian'’ Anabasis Alexandri (The Expedition of Alexander). Biographical sketches can appear in other genres—in oratory, such as the description of the Athenian general Leosthenes in Hyperides’ Funeral Oration (Hyp. 6.1), or in works of history, such as the descriptions of the Spartan Pausanias and the Athenian Themistocles in Thucydides’ history (see Thuc. 1.95.1; Thuc. 1.14.3; Thuc. 1.74.1). The most extensive surviving body of biographical works is Plutarch’s Parallel Lives, biographies of famous Greeks and Romans, which focus on the moral character of their subjects but also provide valuable evidence for political history.Christopher BlackwellParent Institution | TEI| Search | Feedback Christopher W.
