This is a speech that Demosthenes gave at a meeting of the Assembly, and then published later. He delivered this speech sometime in 341 BCE, shortly after the speech On the Chersonese (Dem. 8) (source for date: J.H. Vince, Demosthenes I [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 222). In 341 Philip of Macedon was waging war in Thrace, and so was the Athenian general Diopithes. At Athens, the Assembly was debating sending reinforcements to Diopithes. Demosthenes, in this speech, urges Athens to oppose Philip, noting that the city must form alliances, since Philip is too strong, and his territory too extensive, for Athens to oppose him alone. The speech succeeded in urging the Athenians to action, and within a year Byzantium, on the Hellespont, Euboea, and several other Greek cities allied themselves with Athens to oppose Philip. (See also, Dem. 4, Dem. 6, Dem. 10 â€” all speeches urging opposition to Philip, and Dem. 8, which deals with the same political developments in Thrace).
