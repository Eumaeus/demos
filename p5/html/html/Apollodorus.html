ApollodorosThis article was originally written for the online discussion series ‘Athenian Law in its Democratic Context,’ organized by Adriaan Lanni and sponsored by Harvard University’s Center for Hellenic Studies.Apollodoros, son of Pasion of Acharnai. Apollodoros was born in 394 BC. He was the son of the wealthy banker Pasion and his wife Archippe. Apollodoros was brought up in an affluent household and as a young man he was rather ostentatious, perhaps trying to overcome prejudice among the upper strata of Athenian society for his humble origins (see J. Trevett Apollodoros, the Son of Pasion, Oxford 1992). He tells us that he walked fast and had a loud voice. He married the daughter of Deinias of Athmonon, and had two daughters, one of whom was married to his brother-in-law Theomnestos. He had political ambitions, served as a member of the Boule in 348/7, introduced a decree seeking to expand the resources available for the campaign against Philip, remained a staunch supporter of the anti-Macedonian party, and maintained political alliances with prominent Athenians such as Demosthenes, and even Euboulos in his final years in office. After the death of his father he engaged in prolonged litigation with his younger brother Pasikles over the estate of Pasion. Of the speeches delivered in these court cases we only have the second speech ‘Against Stephanos’ (Dem. 46) written by the hand of Apollodoros. This text is a valuable source of Athenian law because the strategy of Apollodoros in this case was to hit the jury with a barrage of statutes governing inheritance and succession in order to suggest that the law was on his side.Another six speeches transmitted in the manuscripts of Demosthenes were written by Apollodoros (in chronological order: Dem. 53 ‘Against Nikostratos,’ Dem. 52 ‘Against Kallippos,’ Dem. 49 ‘Against Timotheos,’ Dem. 50 ‘Against Polycles,’ Dem. 47 ‘Against Euergos and Mnesiboulos,’ Dem. 59 ‘Against Neaira’). The reason why these speeches survived is probably because they were mistaken for speeches of Demosthenes. However, for us this was a fortunate mistake, as Apollodoros had detailed knowledge of Athenian law and legal procedure, and was always eager to quote laws, decrees, oaths, and other such documents in his speeches. The strengths of Apollodoros as an orator lie in his legal expertise, a truly captivating narrative, skillful manipulation of the jury’s prejudices and fears, morally ambiguous, fascinating characters, and an overall richness that has made his speeches popular samples of Attic oratory.
