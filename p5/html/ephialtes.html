<div class="Summary" id="Summary"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Summary</span></h2>

<p>Ephialtes was a democratic reformer in Athens in the <span class="date">early years of the 5th century BCE</span>. Evidence about him is scanty, although we can learn a certain amoung from Plutarch’s biography of Cimon, who was Ephialtes’ main political opponent (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span></span>). Around <span class="date">462 BCE</span>, Ephialtes brought about changes to the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>. He sponsored laws and decrees that removed many powers from the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> and gave them to the <span class="term">People’s Court</span> or the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. Because the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, consisting of former <span class="term">archons</span> serving on the body for life, was the least democratic of Athens’ political institutions, the reforms of Ephialtes can be said to have completed Athens’ transformation into a radical democracy.</p>

<div class="Section" id="Introduction"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Introduction:</span></h2>


<div class="p">Writing in the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>, the orator Isocrates offers this critical description of Athenian politics in the <span class="date">early 5th century BCE</span>: <blockquote class="quote"><p>…the city waxed powerful and seized the empire of the Hellenes, and our fathers, growing more self-assured than was appropriate for them, began to look with disfavor on those good men and true (<span class="foreign">τοῖς μὲν καλοῖς κἀγαθοῖς τῶν ἀνδρῶν</span>) who had made Athens great, envying them their power, and to crave instead men who were base-born and full of insolence (<span class="foreign">πονηρῶν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων καὶ μεστῶν θρασύτητος ἐπεθύμησαν</span>), thinking that by their bravado and contentiousness they would be able to preserve Democracy (<span class="foreign">διαφυλάττειν τὴν δημοκρατίαν</span>)</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 15.316-317</span>). Aristotle describes the early history of the Athenian democracy in terms of a struggle between two factions in Athens, that of the rich, and that of the <span class="term">People</span>, with individual Athenians leading each party. After the tyranny of Peisistratus and his sons, which ended c.<span class="date">510 BCE</span> (source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>), Isagoras took the side of the rich, and Cleisthenes took the side of the <span class="term">People</span>, then Miltiades and Xanthippus, then Aristides and Themistocles, and then Cimon led the rich, while Ephialtes took the side of the <span class="term">People</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 28.2</span>). The most significant event in the political development of Athenian government in the time of Cimon and Ephialtes, according to Aristotle, was when Ephialtes <span class="quote_inline">put down the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span></span> (<span class="foreign">καταλύσας τὴν Ἀρεοπαγῖτιν βουλήν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.1</span>). Because of the changes to the power and authority of the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>, <span class="quote_inline">it came about that the constitution became still more democratic</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.

<div class="Section" id="Famly"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Ephialtes’ Family and Character</span></h2>


<p>Plutarch did not write a biography of Ephialtes, unfortunately, and so we know many fewer details about him than about other prominent Athenians. Interested readers should read the article on Cimon, Ephialtes’ principle political rival, to fill out the picture of Athenian politics in the <span class="date">first half of the 5th century BCE</span>.</p>

<div class="p">Ephialtes was the son of Sophonides (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.77.6</span>). Aelian includes him in a list of important public figures who were not rich (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Ael. <span class="titlem">VH</span> 2.43</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Ael. <span class="titlem">VH</span> 11.9</span>), which we might contrast to the famous wealth of his political rival Cimon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 6.136.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 4.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 27.2-3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.1</span>-2; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 13.29</span>). Aelian also calls Ephialtes a <span class="quote_inline">philosopher</span>, but what that is supposed to mean is not clear (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Ael. <span class="titlem">VH</span> 3.17</span>).</div>

<p>Ephialtes seems to have held the position of <span class="term">strategos</span> (<span class="foreign">στρατηγός</span>), or <span class="term">General</span>, at Athens, since we hear of him commanding an Athenian fleet in the Aegean, shortly after Cimon’s victories over Persia in <span class="date">467</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 13.5</span>; source for date, <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Apart from these few details, most of what we know about Ephialtes has to do with is greatest political triumph, the reform of the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> at Athens. Diodorus, who is critical of the reform, summarizes the event and adds a ‘moral,’ saying that Ephialtes <blockquote class="quote"><p>persuaded the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to vote to curtail the power of the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus </span>and to destroy the renowned customs which their fathers had followed. Nevertheless, he did not escape the punishment for attempting such lawlessness, but he was done to death by night and none ever knew how he lost his life</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.77.6</span>).</div>

<div class="Section" id="BeforeReforms"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">The Areopagus Before the Reforms.</span></h2>


<p>The <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> (also called the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>), its history, and its role in the Athenian democracy is described at length, with links to the ancient evidence, elsewhere (see <span class="term">Areopagus</span>). What follows is a brief summary of its powers before Ephialtes’ reforms, to help put those reforms in context.</p>

<div class="p">The <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> was an ancient institution. It features in the mythological history of Athens, as portrayed in Aeschylus’ tragedy <span class="titlem">Eumenides</span>, in which the goddess Athene puts the Eumenides, or Furies, on trial on this <span class="term">Hill of the Areopagus</span> at Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aesch. <span class="titlem">Eum.</span></span>). Even under the democratic government of the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>, after much of the power of government was in the hands of the <span class="term">People</span>, this mythology could be invoked for rhetorical effect in the classical period, as when a certain Autocles arguing that a certain Mixidemides should stand trial before the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>: <span class="quote_inline">If the awful goddesses <span class="note" id="Note1"> [<span class="term">i.e.</span> the Furies]</span> were content to stand their trial before the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, should not Mixidemides?</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Rh.</span> 1398b 25</span>). The orator Demosthenes praises the institution and its history: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Concerning that <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> I could relate a greater number of noble stories, in part traditional and legendary, in part certified by our own personal testimony, than could be told of any other tribunal. It is worth your while to listen to one or two of them by way of illustration. First, then, in ancient times, as we are told by tradition, in this court alone the gods condescended both to render and to demand satisfaction for homicide, and to sit in judgement upon contending litigants—Poseidon, according to the legend, deigning to demand justice from Ares on behalf of his son Halirrothius, and the twelve gods to adjudicate between the Eumenides and Orestes. These are ancient stories; let us pass to a later date. This is the only tribunal which no despot, no oligarchy, no democracy, has ever dared to deprive of its jurisdiction in cases of murder, all men agreeing that in such cases no jurisprudence of their own devising could be more effective than that which has been devised in this court</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.65-66</span>). Isocrates, another <span class="date">4th century </span>orator, claims that, once upon a time, the court had authority over the day to day behavior of the citizens: <blockquote class="quote"><p>For our forefathers placed such strong emphasis upon sobriety that they put the supervision of decorum in charge of the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>—a body which was composed exclusively of men who were of noble birth and had exemplified in their lives exceptional virtue and sobriety, and which, therefore, naturally excelled all the other councils of Hellas</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 7.37</span>). Aristotle says that in the time of Draco, the legendary first lawgiver of Athens, <blockquote class="quote"><p>The <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> was guardian of the laws, and kept a watch on the magistrates to make them govern in accordance with the laws. A person unjustly treated might lay a complaint before the Council of the Arepagites <span class="note" id="Note2"> [the members of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>]</span>, stating the law in contravention of which he was treated unjustly</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 4.4</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> was an aristocratic institution, composed of <span class="quote_inline">men who were of noble birth</span> (<span class="foreign">οῖς καλῶς γεγονόσι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 7.37</span>). It was composed of men who had held the office of <span class="term">archon</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.3</span>). Members of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>, the ‘Areopagites’ (<span class="foreign">Ἀρεοπαγίται</span>) held office for life, not only in pre-democratic Athens but also in the <span class="date">latter half of the 4th century</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3.6</span>). According to Aristotle, before the time of the lawgiver Solon—the <span class="date">middle of the 6th century BCE</span> (source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>)—the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> itself chose the men who would be <span class="term">archons</span>, and thus future members of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.1</span>). <span class="quote_inline">Selection of archons was by wealth and birth</span> (<span class="foreign">ἡ γὰρ αἵρεσις τῶν ἀρχόντων ἀριστίνδην καὶ πλουτίνδην ἦν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3.6</span>), and so the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> preserved itself as a body of the aristocrats of Athens.</div>

<div class="p">Solon changed method by which Athenians became <span class="term">archons</span>—forty candidates were elected, and from these forty, nine <span class="term">archons</span> were picked by lot (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.1</span>). Under the laws of Solon, the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> retained its role as <span class="quote_inline">overseer of the constitution</span> (<span class="foreign">ὥσπερ ὑπῆρχεν καὶ πρότερον ἐπίσκοπος οὖσα τῆς πολιτείας</span>); it could punish citizens, fine them, and spend <span class="term">money</span> itself without answering to any other governing body; and it oversaw cases <span class="term">impeachment</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.4</span>). Aristotle describes the government of Athens under Solon as a blend of elements—the <span class="term">courts</span> were democratic, the elected <span class="term">archons</span> were aristocratic, and the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> was oligarchic (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1273b</span>).</div>

<p>The <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> seems to have enjoyed a return to its former glory immediately after the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>. Aristotle tells the story of how, during the chaos of the Persian invasion in <span class="date">480 BCE</span>, the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> took a leading role in organizing, and financing, the evacuation of all Athenians to Salamis and the Peloponnese, which raised the body’s status considerably (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 23.1</span>). He goes on to say that the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> enjoyed preeminence in Athens for almost two decades, until the time when Conon was <span class="term">archon</span>, and Ephialtes brought about his reforms in <span class="date">462 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.1</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>).</p>


</div>

<div class="Section" id="Reforms"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">The Reforms</span></h2>


<div class="p">The ancient sources are not consistent regarding who was responsible for the reform of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>. Aristotle’s <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span>, for example, mentions Ephialtes alone at one point (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.1</span>), Ephialtes and Themistocles elsewhere (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.3</span>-4), and Pericles elsewhere (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 27.1</span>). Plutarch also gives credit to Pericles (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.3</span>), but his description of events helps straighten out the confusion and point to Ephialtes as the man responsible for the reforms themselves: <blockquote class="quote"><p>For this reason all the more did Pericles, strong in the affections of the <span class="term">people</span>, lead a successful party against the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>. <em>Not only was the Council robbed of most of its jurisdiction by</em> Ephialtes, but Cimon also, on the charge of being a lover of Sparta and a hater of the <span class="term">people</span>, was <span class="term">ostracized</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.4</span> <span class="note" id="Note3"> [emphasis added]</span>). Elsewhere in his biography of Pericles, Plutarch refers to Ephialtes as the one <span class="quote_inline">who broke down the power of the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 7.6</span>). According to Plutarch, then, Pericles may have been an important influence behind the events, but it was Ephialtes who actually brought about the reforms (see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1274a</span>, which seems to agree with Plutarch’s version, and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.77.6</span>, which mentions Ephialtes only).</div>


</div>

<div class="Section" id="PoliticalBackground"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">Political Background to Ephialtes’ Reforms: Cimon and Themistocles</span></h2>


<p>In the years following the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, which ended in <span class="date">479 BCE</span> (source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>), the principle advocate of a less democratic, more restricted, government was Cimon, the son of Miltiades (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 4.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.7</span>). Themistocles was a leading advocate of democratic reforms, and Ephialtes seems to have been his successor in this role, after Themistocles was <span class="term">ostracized</span> in <span class="date">472 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Them.</span> 22.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.6</span>-8; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>).</p>

<p>In the years before Ephialtes enacted his reforms, both Cimon and Themistocles stood trial before the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>, and these trials provide an interesting background to Ephialtes’ reforms.</p>

<p>By <span class="date">467 BCE</span>, while the Persians had been mostly driven from the Aegean sea, they remained in the Chersonese, a peninsula in the northern Aegean, and allied themselves with some of the people of Thrace; the Athenians dispatched Cimon to wage war against them (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 14.1</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). Cimon won a victory in Thrace, which would have allowed him, had he wished to, to invade Macedonia. When he failed to do this, he was brought to trial in Athens, accused of accepting bribes to leave Macedonia alone; one of the prosecutors at his trial was Pericles (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 14.2</span>-3). Cimon spoke well in his own defense (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 14.3</span>) and was acquitted, but this trial, at least as Plutarch narrates Cimon’s career, marked the beginning of a period of confrontation between him and the democratic reformers (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 15.1</span>-2; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.7</span>).</p>

<p>Themistocles was himself a member of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>, but was <span class="term">ostracized</span> at the end of the <span class="date">470s BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Them.</span> 22.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.135</span>). While he was in exile, the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> tried him for treason—the charge was ‘Medism,’ or conspiring with Persia—and condemned him to death, although he was absent (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.138</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Them.</span> 22.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.3</span>). According to Aristotle, Themistocles encouraged Ephialtes to limit the powers of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> in order to forestall his own prosecution (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.3</span>-4). This directly contradicts all other sources, who make it clear that Themistocles was not, in fact, in Athens at the time of his trial (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.135</span>-138; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Them.</span> 22.1</span>), but it might suggest that the trial of Themistocles, a famous advocate of democratic reform, influenced Ephialtes.</p>

<p>Cause and effect in history, ancient or modern, are difficult to establish, but we can say this: when Ephialtes enacted his reforms that limited the powers of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>, thus making Athens more democratic (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 27.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 7.6</span>), that court had recently acquitted a famous opponent of democracy and had condemned a famous proponent of democracy.</p>

<p>In the year <span class="date">462</span>, Cimon led an Athenian army to the Peloponnese to help Sparta put down a rebellion, a mission that Ephialtes had opposed (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 16.8</span>). Ephialtes seems to have taken advantage of his absence to enact democratic reforms, especially a reform in the powers and authority of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 15.1</span>-2; for a full discussion of the circumstances of Cimon’s absence, and the timing of Ephialtes’ reforms, see the article on Cimon). Upon Cimon’s return, he was <span class="term">ostracized</span> for ten years (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 17.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.4</span>).</p>


</div>

<div class="Section" id="PoliticalBackgroundTwo"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">Political Background to Ephialtes’ Reforms: the People</span></h2>


<div class="p">According to Aristotle, Ephialtes brought about a reform of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> by denouncing the Court before the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="foreign">τῆς βουλῆς τῶν πεντακοσίων</span>) and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐν τῷ δήμῳ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.4</span>). So the reform was not, finally, the work of Ephialtes alone, but an act of legislation by two of the more democratic institutions in Athens. Aristotle connects this event to a newfound feeling of power among the common <span class="term">people</span> of Athens following the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, when the less wealthy citizens by serving in the navy had saved the city. He makes the connection between naval victories and the reform of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> explicitly in his <span class="titlem">Politics</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1274a</span>), and the <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span> strongly suggests the connection as well: <blockquote class="quote"><p>For he took away some of the functions of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, and he urged the state very strongly in the direction of naval power, which resulted in emboldening the <span class="term">multitude</span>, who brought all the government more into their own hands.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 27.1</span>; note that <span class="quote_inline">he</span> in this quotation is Pericles, but as we have seen this work attributes these reforms to Ephialtes and Pericles, as does the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Politics</span></span> <span class="note" id="Note4"> [see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1274a</span>]</span>).</div>

<p>By <span class="date">462 BCE</span>, when Ephialtes made his reforms, the <span class="term">archons</span> (the future members of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>) were chosen by lot, not by vote (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.5</span>). It is possible that this change made the institution seem less prestigious, and thus worthy of holding fewer powers <span class="note" id="Note5"> [This interesting suggestion is from <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">P.J.

<div class="Section" id="ReformsThemselves"><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">The Reforms Themselves</span></h2>


<div class="p">By means of Ephialtes’ reforms, according to Aristotle, <span class="quote_inline">the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> was deprived of the superintendence of affairs. After this there came about an increased relaxation of the constitution</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 26.1</span>). A fragment from Philochorus, who was a historian writing in the <span class="date">3rd century BCE</span>, offers a little more detail. In his description of the <span class="term">nomophylakes</span>, or <span class="quote_inline">guardians of the laws</span> (<span class="foreign">νομοφύλακες</span>), he says: <span class="quote_inline">There were seven of them, and they were established when Ephialtes left to the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> only those cases pertaining to the body</span> (<span class="foreign">ἑπτὰ δὲ ἦσαν καὶ κατέστησαν, ὡς Φιλόχορος, ὅτε Ἐφιάλτης μόνα κατέλιπε τῇ ἐξ Ἀρείου πάγου βουλῇ τὰ ὑπὲρ τοῦ σώματος</span>) (<span class="bibl">Philoch. fr. 64</span>).</div>

<div class="p">To understand what Aristotle means by <span class="quote_inline">deprived of superintendence of affairs</span>, or what Philochorus means by <span class="quote_inline">only those cases pertaining to the body</span> we can only look at comments in the sources about the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>’ role after Ephialtes’ reforms. Aristotle, describing the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> and its functions in <span class="date">the middle of the 4th century BCE</span> (over a century after Ephialtes’ reforms), says that this court had authority over trials of murder, wounding, death by poison, and arson, but that other similar crimes—involuntary manslaughter, murder of slaves or foreigners, accidental killings, or killings in self-defense—come before other <span class="term">courts</span>, the <span class="term">Court of the Palladium</span> or the <span class="term">Court of the Delphinium</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.3</span>). A law quoted in a speech by Demosthenes agrees (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.22</span>); but it is important to remember that laws quoted in speeches may have been added to the manuscript later, sometime centuries later.</div>

<div class="p">If Ephialtes’ reforms took many crimes out of the jurisdiction of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> and assigned them to other <span class="term">courts</span>, with <span class="term">juries</span> of citizens, then there would have been a greater need for citizens to serve on <span class="term">juries</span>. And, in fact, several of the accounts of Ephialtes and Pericles reforming the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> also the institution of pay for <span class="term">jury</span> service, an innovation that may have aimed at meeting this new need. Aristotle relates the two reforms very closely, and relates them both to an increasingly democratic government: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Ephialtes and Pericles docked the power of the Council on the Areopagus, while Pericles instituted payment for serving in the <span class="term">law-courts</span>, and in this manner finally the successive leaders of the <span class="term">people</span> led them on by growing stages to the present democracy</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1274a</span>; also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 27.2</span>-3).</div>

<p>The evidence from the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span> shows the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> performing other functions, but it is impossible to say whether those were left by Ephialtes, or they were added sometime after his reforms. At the <span class="date">end of the 5th century BCE</span>, after Athens had lost the <span class="term">Peloponnesian War</span>, the city was governed for a short time by the so-called Thirty Tyrants, whose first order of business was to undo Ephialtes’ reforms (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 35.2</span>). After the Thirty Tyrants were, themselves, overthrown, the city returned to democratic rule (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 36</span>-41). It is possible that the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> was given new authority over specific matters at this time. For example, in the <span class="date">4th century</span> the court had authority over people accused of digging up sacred olive trees, the penalty for which death or exile (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 60.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 7.22</span>). We also find them investigating matters pertaining to piety, but with limited powers of punishment (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.80</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Ephialtes’ reforms took authority away from the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> and put it into the hands of the <span class="term">people</span>, but the court did retain its status as a time-honored and exalted institution. At the <span class="date">beginning of the 4th century</span>, Lysias could say to the Athenians, <blockquote class="quote"><p>you have, in the <span class="term">council of the Areopagus</span>, the finest model in Greece: a court so superior to others that even the men convicted in it admit that its judgements are just</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 1.12</span>). Half a century later, Aeschines offers this praise for the body: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Take the example of the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>, the most scrupulous tribunal in the city. I myself have before now seen many men convicted before this tribunal, though they spoke most eloquently, and presented witnesses; and I know that before now certain men have won their case, although they spoke most feebly, and although no witnesses testified for them. For it is not on the strength of the pleading alone, nor of the testimony alone, that the members of the court give their verdict, but on the strength of their own knowledge and their own investigations. And this is the reason why that tribunal maintains its high repute in the city.</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">χρήσασθε δὴ παραδείγματι τῇ βουλῇ τῇ ἐξ Ἀρείου πάγου, τῷ ἀκριβεστάτῳ συνεδρίῳ τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει. πολλοὺς γὰρ ἤδη ἔγωγε τεθεώρηκα ἐν τῷ βουλευτηρίῳ τούτῳ εὖ πάνυ εἰπόντας καὶ μάρτυρας πορισαμένους ἁλόντας· ἤδη δέ τινας κακῶς πάνυ διαλεχθέντας καὶ πρᾶγμα ἀμάρτυρον ἔχοντας οἶδα νικήσαντας. οὐ γὰρ ἐκ τοῦ λόγου μόνον οὐδ᾽ ἐκ τῶν μαρτυριῶν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐξ ὧν αὐτοὶ συνίσασι καὶ ἐξητάκασι, τὴν ψῆφον φέρουσι. τοιγάρτοι διατελεῖ τοῦτο τὸ συνέδριον εὐδοκιμοῦν ἐν τῇ πόλει.</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.92</span>).</div>

<div class="Section" id="Death"><h2><span class="headingNumber">9. </span><span class="head">The Death of Ephialtes</span></h2>


<div class="p">Aristotle says that, shortly after reforming the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>, Ephialtes was kidnapped and murdered by Aristodicus of Tanagra (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.2</span>; also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 10.7</span>, who cites Aristotle as his source). Other sources do not think that the case of Ephialtes’ murder is so easily solved, however. Diodorus, highly critical of Ephialtes’ democratic reforms, describes the man’s end in moral terms: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Ephialtes the son of Sophonides, who, being a popular leader, had provoked the <span class="term">masses</span> to anger against the Areopagites, persuaded the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to vote to curtail the power of the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> and to destroy the renowned customs which their fathers had followed. Nevertheless, he did not escape the punishment for attempting such lawlessness, but he was done to death by night and none ever knew how he lost his life</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.77.6</span>). Plutarch says that the historian Idomeneus—who lived in the <span class="date">late 4th</span> and <span class="date">early 3rd centuries BCE</span> (source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>)—actually accused Pericles of murdering Ephialtes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 10.6</span>). In his own century, the <span class="date">5th century BCE</span>, Ephialtes’ murders were not known (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Antiph. 5.68</span>).</div>

<p>Plutarch, whose judgement of Ephialtes’ reforms and their effect on the people of Athens is highly critical (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 7.6</span>), nevertheless names the reformer as one of the founders of Athens’ prosperity and power in the <span class="date">5th century</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 16.2</span>).</p>
