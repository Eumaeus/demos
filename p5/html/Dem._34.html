<div class="p">Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Against Phormio</span>, see also Oratory. This is a speech written by Demosthenes on behalf of Chrysippus and his partner for a lawsuit that they have filed against Phormio, an Athenian merchant (this is not the same Phormio who appears in <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 36</span>). Chrysippus loaned Phormio twenty minae (see also <span class="term">Money</span>) to ship a cargo to Bosporus, in the Crimea. He did this with the understanding that he would be repaid along with thirty percent interest when Phormio returned from the journey. When Phormio reached the Bosporus, he found that he was unable to sell the goods because of a war in the area. So he sent the ship back to Athens, but the ship sank on the return journey. This speech was not given as part of an actual trial on the issues, but in response to a special plea (<span class="foreign">τῆς παραγραφῆς</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 34.3</span>) brought by Phormio aimed at preventing the matter from going to trial. Phormio claims that, because the ship sank, he is not contractually bound to repay the twenty minae and should not be brought to trial. On the other hand, Chrysippus asserts that, from the very beginning of their dealings, Phormio tried to defraud him and thus should be responsible for the loan (plus interest) and should be brought to trial for his actions. This speech is unusual in that there are two speakers. It seems that Chryssipus delivered the first part of the speech, and his partner began speaking at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 34.21</span>; the speaker at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 35.23</span> refers to Chrysippus as <span class="quote_inline">my partner here</span> (<span class="foreign">οὗτος᾿</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 34.23</span>). Because the speech mentions Alexander the Great’s capture of the city of Thebes, this speech can be dated to some time after <span class="date">335 BCE</span>, when that event took place (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 34.38</span>) (source for date: <span class="bibl">A.T. Murray, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes IV</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1946] 262n.</span>).</div>
