 <p>This article argues that poetry—the Homeric epics and the works of the
 tragedians—enjoyed an importance to the democratic government of
 Athens equal to that of the city’s laws. Like laws, poetry was
 powerful. Like the law, too, poetry was regulated and, at times, manipulated
 according to the political needs of the city and its rulers.</p>

 <div class="p"> The pervasive civic importance of poetry in Athenian democracy during the
 <span class="date">fifth and fourth centuries BCE</span>
 has been obvious since ancient times. The figure Demades in Plutarch calls the
 <span class="term">
 ‘theoric fund’
 </span>, which paid for the entrance fee into dramatic festivals for all
 citizens, the <span class="quote_inline">glue of the democracy</span> (<span class="foreign">ὡς
 ἔλεγε Δημάδης, κόλλαν ὀνομάζων τὰ θεωρικὰ τῆς
 δημοκρατίας</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Platonic Questions</span> 1011b</span>). In Aeschines’s oration <span class="titlem">Against
 Timarchus</span>, Aeschines asks his jury
 to apply wisdom from the poetry of Euripides
 in their judgment of the case before them: </div>
 <blockquote class="quote block">
 <p>
 <span class="foreign">Σκέψασθε δέ, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, τὰς γνῶμας ἃς
 ἀποφαίνεται ὁ ποιητής. Ἤδη δὲ πολλῶν πραγμάτων φησὶ
 γεγενῆσθαι κριτής, ὥσπερ νῦν ὑμεῖς δικασταί, καὶ τὰς κρίσεις
 οὐκ ἐκ τῶν μαρτυριῶν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκ τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων καὶ τῶν
 ὁμιλιῶν φησι ποιεῖσθαι... οὐκ ὤκνησεν ἀποφήνασθαι τοιοῦτον
 εἶναι οἷσπερ ἥδεται ξυνών. Οὐκοῦν δίκαιον καὶ περὶ
 Τιμάρχου τοῖς αὐτοῖς ὑμᾶς Εὐριπίδῃ χρήσασθαι
 λογισμοῖς.</span>
 </p>
 <p>Consider, O Athenians, the sentiments that the poet expresses. He says that
 in the past he has been the arbiter of many disputes, just as you jurors are
 now, and he says that he makes his decisions not based on the testimony of
 witnesses, but on the habits and company of the defendant… he did
 not shrink from claiming that a man’s character is none other than
 that of those with whom he likes to associate. Therefore it is right for you
 also to use the same logic as Euripides in
 the case of Timarchus. (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschines, <span class="titlem">Against
 Timarchus</span> 153</span>) </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p> In fact throughout his prosecution Aeschines
 provides carefully selected citations of Homer
 and the tragedians to support his claim that Timarchus has led the kind of life which, according to Athenian law,
 precludes him from speaking in the democratic <span class="term">assembly</span>. Moreover, whenever Aeschines cites poetry, he uses the same wording as when he cites a law
 or an affidavit: he calls on the <span class="term">grammateus</span> to read out specific
 passages, and then he comments upon them. Compare the following two passages: </p>
 <blockquote class="quote block">
 <p>
 <span class="foreign">
 <em>Ἀναγνώσεται οὖν ὑμῖν τούτους τοὺς νόμους ὁ

 was brought up well would be a good citizen. But whenever human nature
 receives a depraved beginning to its education straightaway from childhood,
 he believed that the citizens that resulted from such badly brought up
 children would be like this man Timarchus. Read
 (<span class="foreign">λέγε</span>) for them these laws. (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">

 <p>
 Aeschines’ use of Homer and Euripides as evidence in a court case shows the student of the Athenian
 <span class="term">dēmos</span> a great deal about the important role that
 poetry played in the democracy. Like written laws that guaranteed constitutional
 rights for all citizens, the poetry of Homer
 and tragedy was the common intellectual and
 moral property of the <span class="term">dēmos</span>, and a standard by which
 behavior could be assessed. The <span class="term">law court</span>
 with its jury of citizens was a place in which the behavior of individuals was
 constantly being evaluated in relation to the values of the <span class="term">polis</span>
 as a whole.</p>
 <p> It is essential for any student of the Athenian <span class="term">dēmos</span> to
 understand the authority of poetry in the civic discourse of Athens. The authority of poetry, moreover, is not
 restricted to tragedy (as we have seen) nor to
 disputes in the courts. Carolyn Higbie has shown the way in which Homer and the Iliadic ‘past’
 could be cited as authoritative evidence in all sorts of disputes, including
 Athenian claims to the island of Salamis
 and an incident that Herodotus relates in
 which the Athenians and Spartans make their claims to command of the Greek navy
 and army against the Persians before Gelon of
 Syracuse.<span class="note" id="Note1"> [

 other orators. </p>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="Guarding"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Guarding Poetic Texts</span></h2>
 
 <p> But the formula by which Aeschines calls upon
 the <span class="term">grammateus</span> to read aloud a segment of poetry raises for me many
 questions. What text does the <span class="term">grammateus</span> read when he is called
 upon to do so? Is it one provided by Aeschines? What kind of state texts, if any, existed for Homer and the tragedians? I would like to
 explore the question of state regulation of dramatic texts in the context of the
 definition of poetry that I have given above—that is the common
 intellectual and moral property of the <span class="term">dēmos</span>. To what
 extent, and more importantly, why did the Athenian democracy regulate that
 possession? Plutarch’s <span class="titlem">Lives
 of the Ten Orators</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Mor.</span> 841F (<span class="titlem">Praecepta Gerendae Reipublicae</span>)</span>) mentions a
 Lycurgan law that called for official state copies of the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides to be placed
 in the Metroon: </p>
 <blockquote class="quote block">
 <p>
 <span class="foreign">τὸν δέ, </span>…<span class="foreign">
 χαλκᾶς εἰκόνας ἀναθεῖναι τῶν ποιητῶν, Αἰσχύλου Σοφοκλέους

 <p>[Next he proposed] that bronze statues of the poets Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides be
 set up, and that written copies of their tragedies be guarded in the public
 treasury and that the <span class="term">grammateus</span> of the <span class="term">polis</span> read
 them out publicly (<span class="foreign">παραναγινώσκειν</span>) to the
 actors. (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plutarch <span class="titlem">Lives of the Ten Orators</span> 841f</span>)</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p> It is generally believed that this was done to protect the texts from
 actors’ or other kinds of interpolation which was corrupting the
 textual tradition of the plays and likewise their subsequent performance, and
 the verb <span class="foreign">παραναγινώσκειν</span> has another meaning that
 may be relevant here, which is ‘to collate’ or ‘to
 compare’. That the texts would need to be protected from
 insertions is an interesting one to which I will return. </p>
 <p> For the moment I am interested in the word <span class="foreign">φυλάττειν</span> (‘to guard’ or ‘to
 protect’) which Plutarch tells us
 was the purpose of the law. This word has a military connotation which is
 intriguing, but it also turns the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides into a <span class="term">ktēma</span> (a
 ‘possession’) of the sort Thucydides hoped his history would be (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.22</span>). This is a possession that
 the Athenian <span class="term">dēmos</span> wants to keep and store away in the
 Metroon in its function as a
 treasury, in order to regulate and control how that possession is used. The
 Metroon is also of course the
 Athenian archive, a place where laws are kept. The <span class="term">grammateus</span> in
 fact, that same figure who as we have seen reads out the laws and affidavits and
 citations of poetry to the jury, according to the law of Lycurgus will read out the plays to the actors so that they can
 learn their parts. It is not clear whether the actors were even allowed to make
 copies for themselves (and again the meaning of the verb <span class="foreign">παραναγινώσκειν</span> comes in to play here). </p>

 <p> I would like to suggest that this kind of regulation of poetry by the Athenian
 democracy is reminiscent of the control over poetry once asserted by the
 Peisistratid tyranny. Gregory Nagy, in his 1990 book <span class="titlem">
 Pindar’s Homer

 tyrant’s wealth, power, and prestige.<span class="note" id="Note3"> [

 Kleomenes had taken possession of these oracular

 image that the Peisistratids tried to convey of themselves as owners but at the
 same time sharers of poetry through public performance. In the pseudo-Platonic
 dialogue <span class="titlem">Hipparchus</span> we see such a positive portrayal of Hipparchus in connection with the introduction of epic
 performances at the Panathenaia, the conveying of the poet Anacreon to Athens from Teos, Hipparchus’ patronage of Simonides of Keos, and the display of poetry on Herm statues which Hipparchus had set up in the countryside.<span class="note" id="Note5"> [

 control the public medium, there is the ever-present danger of a
 premeditated selective control over the content of poetry, leading to
 stealthy distortions or perversions of the poetic truth.</p></blockquote>
 </div>
 <p> It is interesting that the control of poetry by tyrants threatens a perversion
 of truth, while regulation of dramatic texts by the <span class="term">dēmos</span>
 serves to protect the texts from insertions or alterations and even performance
 by others. There is no guarantee of course that the Athenian state copies of
 these texts were not already quite corrupted. We know very little about the
 publication and circulation of books within the lifetime and in the century
 after the deaths of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, but it must have been sporadic and completely
 unregulated. We have no idea on what exemplar the Athenian state texts were to
 be based in the Lycurgan law. I think we can see that the
 <span class="term">dēmos</span> in its attempt to protect the texts assumes the role
 that the tyrant once played in its selective control of poetry.</p>

 <p> I see state regulation of poetry as one of many points of contact with the
 Peisistratid tyranny in which the <span class="term">dēmos</span> itself becomes a
 kind of ‘tyrant.’ The Tholos, for example, which housed the Prytaneis—those
 groups of 50 representatives from each of the ten tribes who held the
 ‘prytany’ or presidency of the <span class="term">Council</span> of 500 in rotation and were fed in the Tholos at public expense—was
 built on the spot where a building which is thought to have been the home of the

 ]</span> At this critical time (that is <span class="date">ca 500 BC</span>)
 comes the first stone theater of Dionysus at the foot of the Acropolis. The organization of the
 great Athenian dramatic festival at the birth of the democracy is an assertion
 of power by way of the control of poetry, not unlike the reorganization of the
 Panathenaia by the Peisistratids. </p>
 <p>
 <span class="date">More than a century and a half later</span> after the battle
 of Chaeronea
 Athens was once again in a position in which
 it needed to assert control. Lycurgus, a prominent
 statesman with either enormous personal influence or else acting in some
 official capacity undertook at this time a building program. Among other
 projects the docks and harbors and various things in connection with the navy
 were increased and improved, and the theater of Dionysus was rebuilt.
 Lycurgus was also at this time in charge of
 festivals and processions, and in this context presumably he proposed the law
 concerning the dramatists. I stress the navy and the theater in conjunction as
 the means by which Athens, under the
 direction of Lycurgus, attempted to rebuild and
 reassert the authority of the <span class="term">polis</span> after Chaeronea. Just as for the tyrants of archaic
 Greece, the possession and control of poetry and its performance was a crucial
 (though ultimately unsuccessful) demonstration of wealth, power, and prestige
 for the Athenian <span class="term">dēmos</span> in the years following <span class="date">338</span>. </p>
 <p> To conclude I would like to return to the parallels I raised in the beginning
 between citations of laws and poetry by orators as evidence in the <span class="term">law courts</span>. Aeschines and other proponents of democracy name written laws to
 which all citizens are bound, that is <span class="term">isonomia</span>, as the cornerstone
 of any democratic government. The Persian Otanes
 points out in <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Herodotus
 3.82</span> that tyranny and oligarchy have the power to cast aside law,
 disregard it or distort it (<span class="foreign">τῇ ἔξεστι ἀνευθύνῳ
 ποιέειν τὰ βούλεται</span>… <span class="foreign">νόμαιά τε
 κινέει πάτρια</span>). In a democracy, laws are the common property of
 all citizens: </p>
 <blockquote class="quote block">
 <p>
 <span class="foreign">διοικοῦνται δ᾽ αἱ μὲν τυραννίδες καὶ ὀλιγαρχίαι
 τοῖς τρόποις τῶν ἐφεστηκότων, αἱ δὲ πόλεις αἱ δημοκρατούμεναι
 τοῖς νόμοις τοῖς κειμένοις</span>… <span class="foreign">ὑμῖν δὲ τοῖς τὴν ἴσην καὶ ἔννομον πολιτείαν ἔχουσι τοὺς
 παρὰ τοὺς νόμους ἢ λέγοντας ἢ βεβιωκότας· ἐντεῦθεν γὰρ
 ἰσχύσετε, ὅταν εὐνομῆσθε</span>…</p>
 <p>Autocracies and oligarchies are administered according to the tempers of
 their lords, but democratic states according to established laws. And be
 assured, fellow citizens, that in a democracy it is the laws that guard the
 person of the citizen and the constitution of the state… but you,
 who have a government based upon equality and law, must guard against those
 whose words violate the laws or whose lives have defied them; for then only
 will you be strong, when you cherish the laws (<span class="foreign">εὐνομῆσθε</span>)… (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschines <span class="titlem">Against
 Timarchus</span> 4-5</span>) </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p> I would point out to the student of the Athenian democracy that poetry, like the
 laws, had power, and for that reason it had to be regulated—that is
 protected and guarded against those who would violate it. </p>
 <p> But I also think that if we focus too closely on the importance of the state
 copies for the establishment of the text we are missing the point somewhat. The
 law (in the only source in which we have it) does not specify from what exemplar
 the state copies are to be made. We will probably never know if the law did in
 fact specify such a thing. What we do know of the law is that the texts were to
 be placed in the Metroon, and
 statues of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides were to be placed in the theater. This suggests two things: 1) that the law
 had an honorific purpose, and not necessarily textual one. And 2) that the
 poetry of these three great tragedians was being symbolically elevated to the
 status of law in the civic discourse, as we so often find in the law courts and
 public speeches in the <span class="date">fourth
 century</span>.</p>

 <span class="note" id="Note9"> [For another study of the use of
 Homeric and other poetry in the Athenian public arena, see also <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Andrew Ford, “Reading Homer from the Rostrum:
 Poems and Laws in Aeschines” <span class="titlem">Against
 Timarchus</span>’ (in <span class="titlem">Performance Culture and Athenian
 Democracy</span>, ed. Simon Goldhill and Robin Osborne,
 1999</span>; as well as <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">S. Perlman, “Quotations
 from Poetry in Attic Orators of the Fourth Century BCE”
 [<span class="titlem">American Journal of Philology</span> 85 (1964):
 155-172]</span>). Ford adduces many of the same key passages that I have
 examined here, but his argument differs from mine. Whereas Ford stresses the
 individual motives of public speakers in seeking to display their education
 and sophistication in their citations of Homeric and other poetry for their
 ad hoc legal or political argumentation, I argue for the inherent
 traditional authority of such poetic traditions, from the archaic period
 onward, in civic discourse.]</span>
