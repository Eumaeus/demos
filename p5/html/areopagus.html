<div class="Summary" id="Summary"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Summary</span></h2>

<p>The Areopagus, or ‘Hill of Ares’ (<span class="foreign">Ἀρεῖος πάγος</span>), in Athens was the site of a council that served as an important legal institution under the Athenian democracy. This body, called the ‘Council of the Areopagus,’ or simply the ‘Areopagus,’ existed long before the democracy, and its powers and composition changed many times over the centuries. Originally, it was the central governing body of Athens, but under the democracy, it was a primarily the court with jurisdiction over cases of homicide and certain other serious crimes. After an Athenian had served as one of the nine <span class="term">archons</span>, his conduct in office was investigated, and if he passed that investigation he became a member of the Areopagus. Tenure was for life.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Introduction"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Introduction</span></h2>


<div class="p">The Areopagus (<span class="foreign">Ἀρεῖος πάγος</span>) was a hill in Athens, south of the Agora, to the north-west of the Acropolis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 8.52</span>). The term ‘Areopagus,’ however, often refers to the <span class="quote_inline">Council of the Areopagus</span> (<span class="foreign">ἡ βουλὴ ἡ ἐξ Ἀρείου πάγου</span>), a governmental institution that met on that hill (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.92</span>). This institution was very ancient, existing long before democratic government. Its history, which recedes back into mythological pre-history, follows closely the political history of Athens, and shows the ongoing tension between democratic and anti-democratic forces (see, for example, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 15.316</span>, in which he complains that as the city grew more democratic, the power of the older institutions, such as the Areopagus, declined). In this article, we will first present the evidence for the composition, procedures, and jurisdiction of the Council of the Areopagus in the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>, when it was one of the institutions of the fully developed Athenian democracy. Then we will give the evidence that describes its history. Finally, we will give some evidence for special functions that the Areopagus seemed to perform in the later <span class="date">4th century</span>.</div>

</div>

<div class="Section" id="FourthCentury"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">The <span class="date">4th c.</span></span></h2>


<div class="p">The Council of the Areopagus functioned as a court under the democracy of <span class="date">4th century</span> Athens, and it had a very high reputation (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.65</span>). The orator Lycurgus tells his fellow Athenians that, <blockquote class="quote"><p>you have, in the Council of the Areopagus, the finest model in Greece: a court so superior to others that even the men convicted in it admit that its judgements are just</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lyc. 1.12</span>). Aeschines speaks of the Areopagus in similar terms but praises the institution at greater length: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Take the example of the Council of the Areopagus, the most scrupulous tribunal in the city. I myself have before now seen many men convicted before this tribunal, though they spoke most eloquently and presented witnesses; and I know that before now certain men have won their case, although they spoke most feebly, and although no witnesses testified for them. For it is not on the strength of the pleading alone, nor of the testimony alone, that the members of the court give their verdict, but on the strength of their own knowledge and their own investigations. And this is the reason why that tribunal maintains its high repute in the city</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.92</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">Members of the Areopagus individually and the institution generally were held in high regard and considered to be worthy of respect. Aeschines reports an incident when Autolycus, a member of the Areopagus, unwittingly made a sexual pun; when the people laughed, Pyrrandrus scolded them, asking if they <span class="quote_inline">were not ashamed of themselves for laughing in the presence of the Council of the Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.84</span>). Aeschines is careful to defend Autolycus, as <span class="quote_inline">a man whose life has been good and pious, and so worthy of that body <span class="note" id="Note1"> [i.e. the Areopagus]</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.82</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">The principle function of the Areopagus, in the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>, was to try cases of homicide. Demosthenes describes this function and the lengths to which the court went to ensure that its proceedings were fair and just; this passage, addressed to the Athenians, also suggests that the Athenians saw a strong relationship between human and divine justice: <blockquote class="quote"><p>You are all of course aware that in the Areopagus, where the law both permits and enjoins the trial of homicide, first, every man who brings accusation of such a crime must make oath by invoking destruction upon himself, his kindred, and his household; secondly, that he must not treat this oath as an ordinary oath, but as one which no man swears for any other purpose; for he stands over the entrails of a boar, a ram, and a bull, and they must have been slaughtered by the necessary officers and on the days appointed, so that in respect both of the time and of the functionaries every requirement of solemnity has been satisfied. Even then the person who has sworn this tremendous oath does not gain immediate credence; and if any falsehood is brought home to him, he will carry away with him to his children and his kindred the stain of perjury—but gain nothing. If, on the other hand, he is believed to be laying a just charge, and if he proves the accused guilty of murder, even then he has no power over the convicted criminal; only the laws and the appointed officers have power over the man for punishment.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.67</span>-69).

</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Composition"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Composition in the 4th c.</span></h2>


<div class="p">The Areopagus consisted of former <span class="term">archons</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.22</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 60.3</span>). This meant that all members of the Areopagus had been thoroughly investigated by officials of the democracy. All <span class="term">archons</span> were subject to <span class="quote_inline">scrutiny</span> (<span class="foreign">δοκιμασία</span>) by the <span class="term">Thesmothetae</span> (the lower six of the nine <span class="term">archons</span>)—an investigation into their qualifications to serve—before they assumed their office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.9</span>). So, in a passage from Xenophon, the Areopagus is said to <span class="quote_inline">consist of those who have undergone scrutiny</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐκ τῶν δεδοκιμασμένων καθίσταται</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 3.5.20</span>). At the end of their year of service, each <span class="term">archon</span> was investigated by the ‘<span class="term">People’s Court</span>;’ only those <span class="term">archons</span> who passed this public audit (<span class="foreign">εὔθυνα</span>) could become members of the Areopagus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 26.5</span>). An <span class="term">archon</span> could fail this audit (<span class="foreign">εὔθυνα</span>) by violating any of the laws governing the conduct of his office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.22</span>). For example, the <span class="term">Eponymous Archon</span> was responsible for collecting and holding the olive oil that was given as a prize at the <span class="term">Panathenaic Games</span>; this <span class="term">archon</span> was not allowed to become a member of the Areopagus until he had handed all of the oil over to the <span class="term">treasurers</span> (<span class="foreign">οἱ ταμίαι</span>) on the Acropolis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 60.3</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">Appointment to the Areopagus was for life (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3.6</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.11</span>). Nevertheless, members of the Areopagus, the Areopagites, were still subject to audit (<span class="foreign">εὔθυνα</span>). Aeschines describes this to his fellow Athenians as a democratic measure: <blockquote class="quote"><p>For, first, the Council of the Areopagus is required by the law to file its accounts with the <span class="term">Board of Auditors</span> and to submit to their examination; yes, even those men, who sit with solemn aspect yonder as the court of highest competence, are brought under your verdict</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.20</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">When Aristotle says that service on the Areopagus was for life, he describes that service as an <span class="quote_inline">office</span> (<span class="foreign">ἀρχή</span>): <span class="quote_inline">It alone of the offices was held for life, as it is even now</span> (<span class="foreign">διὸ καὶ μόνη τῶν ἀρχῶν αὕτη μεμένηκε διὰ βίου καὶ νῦν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3.6</span>). But it was clearly not like the other offices in that someone could be an Areopagite and hold other offices at the same time. When Athenians were sworn in as <span class="term">jurors</span> in the <span class="term">People’s Court</span>, they swore <span class="quote_inline">not to suffer the same man to hold the same office twice, or two offices in the same year</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.150</span>). But we know from an inscription that a man named Euboulos was one of the <span class="term">Thesmothetae</span> in <span class="date">370/69</span>, and an Areopagite from <span class="date">369</span> on (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">SEG</span> 19 133</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, p. 289</span>). But we also know that Euboulos was on the board of the <span class="term">Theoric Fund</span> in the <span class="date">350s</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.25</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, p. 289</span>).
</div>
<p>Members of the Areopagus seem to have received a free portion of the meat from certain sacrifices, an added benefit of service (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.56</span>)

</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="MeetingPlaces"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">Meeting Places in the 4th c.</span></h2>


<p>The Council of the Areopagus met generally on the Areopagus, the Hill of Ares (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.65-66</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 7.38</span>). Demosthenes mentions the body also meeting in the Stoa Basileus in the Agora, which was roped off for the occasion, so the court would not be disturbed (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 25.23</span>).
</p>
<div class="p">But the Hill of Ares was its proper meeting place, and that location was rich in symbolic importance. A <span class="date">4th century</span> inscription records a law that seems aimed at preventing the overthrow of the Athenian democracy. It says that, <blockquote class="quote"><p>If the <span class="term">People</span> or the democracy at Athens are overthrown, no member of the Council of the Areopagus shall go up to the Areopagus or meet in the <span class="term">Council</span> or discuss any single thing</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">SEG</span> 12 87</span>). This suggests two things. First, the site of the Hill of Ares lent legitimacy to whatever went on there—and so the authors of this law wanted to deny that meeting place to any government that followed the overthrow of the democracy. Second, the law suggests that the members of the Council of the Areopagus were assumed to be people of great authority—and so the authors of this law wanted to prevent them from exercising that authority after the overthrow of the democracy. Aristotle says that, at least when the Areopagus was acting in its role as a murder court, it met <span class="quote_inline">in the sacred precinct, in the open air</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐν ἱερῷ καὶ ὑπαίθριοι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.4</span>).

</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Procedure"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">Procedure in the 4th c.</span></h2>


<div class="p">The Areopagus, functioning as a court of law during the <span class="date">4th century</span>, had a reputation for following unimpeachable procedures. In his speech against Aristocrates, Demosthenes describes this procedure at some length, and begins his description with the claim that <span class="quote_inline">no convicted defendant and no defeated prosecutor has ever made good any complaint against the justice of the verdict given.</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.66</span>). Anyone who brought an accusation of homicide before the court had to swear an oath <span class="quote_inline">invoking destruction upon himself, his kindred, and his household</span> (<span class="foreign">πρῶτον μὲν διομεῖται κατ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἐξωλείας αὑτοῦ καὶ γένους καὶ οἰκίας ὅ τιν᾽ αἰτιώμενος εἰργάσθαι τι τοιοῦτον</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.67</span>). The swearing of this oath was unique: a boar, a ram, and a bull were to be sacrificed by certain people and on certain days (Demosthenes does not say which people or which days), <span class="quote_inline">so that in respect both of the time and of the functionaries every requirement of solemnity has been satisfied</span> (<span class="foreign">ὥστε καὶ ἐκ τοῦ χρόνου καὶ ἐκ τῶν μεταχειριζομένων ἅπαν, ὅσον ἔσθ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ὅσιον, πεπρᾶχθαι</span>); the accuser then stood over the entrails of the sacrificed animals and swore his oath. Demosthenes is careful to add that, even with this <span class="quote_inline">tremendous oath</span> (<span class="foreign">τὸν τοιοῦτον ὅρκον</span>), the accuser was not automatically believed, and that if he should be proved to have lied, not only would he bear <span class="quote_inline">the stain of perjury</span> (<span class="foreign">τὴν ἐπιορκίαν</span>) himself, but his children and relatives would as well (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.68</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">In this speech and elsewhere, Demosthenes emphasizes the extent to which the rights of the accused were protected by law and procedure. If the accuser won his case, and the accused was convicted, the accuser had no power of punishment: <blockquote class="quote"><p>only the laws and the appointed officer have power over the man for punishment. The prosecutor is permitted to see him suffering the penalty awarded by law, and that is all.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.69</span>). If the Areopagus found a defendant guilty in a case of homicide, the court seems to have had the authority to hand him straight over to the executioner (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.62</span>; although this passage refers to powers given to the Areopagus by a particular decree in the <span class="date">late 4th century</span>). In other matters, though the Areopagus’ power of punishment was not unlimited. Speaking of a case of impiety, Apollodorus says that the court <span class="quote_inline">does not have the power to punish any of the Athenians as they see fit.</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.80</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">Defendants swore the same oath as accusers, but Demosthenes says that they had an important additional right: <blockquote class="quote"><p>it is permitted to them to depart after giving his first speech, and neither the prosecutor, nor the jurors, nor any other man is authorized to prevent it</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">τὸν πρότερον δ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἔξεστιν εἰπόντα λόγον μεταστῆναι, καὶ οὔθ᾽ ὁ διώκων οὔθ᾽ οἱ δικάζοντες οὔτ᾽ ἄλλος ἀνθρώπων οὐδεὶς κύριος κωλῦσαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.69</span>). We may suppose (although Demosthenes does not make this clear) that the defendant would have to leave Athens after withdrawing from the trial.
</div>
<div class="p">The trial would proceed with each side giving one or more speeches (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.1</span>, where he says that he does not have to give all the details of the case because a fellow-prosecutor, Stratocles, has already given his speech). Aeschines, speaking in praise of the Areopagus, says that this court was different from the other courts of Athens in that Areopagites were less likely than other jurors to be swayed by skillful speaking alone: <blockquote class="quote"><p>I myself have before now seen many men convicted before this tribunal, though they spoke most eloquently, and presented witnesses; and I know that before now certain men have won their case, although they spoke most feebly, and although no witnesses testified for them. For it is not on the strength of the pleading alone, nor of the testimony alone, that the members of the court give their verdict, but on the strength of their own knowledge and their own investigations. And this is the reason why that tribunal maintains its high repute in the city.</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">πολλοὺς γὰρ ἤδη ἔγωγε τεθεώρηκα ἐν τῷ βουλευτηρίῳ τούτῳ εὖ πάνυ εἰπόντας καὶ μάρτυρας πορισαμένους ἁλόντας· ἤδη δέ τινας κακῶς πάνυ διαλεχθέντας καὶ πρᾶγμα ἀμάρτυρον ἔχοντας οἶδα νικήσαντας. οὐ γὰρ ἐκ τοῦ λόγου μόνον οὐδ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἐκ τῶν μαρτυριῶν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐξ ὧν αὐτοὶ συνίσασι καὶ ἐξητάκασι, τὴν ψῆφον φέρουσι. τοιγάρτοι διατελεῖ τοῦτο τὸ συνέδριον εὐδοκιμοῦν ἐν τῇ πόλει.</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.92</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">The <span class="term">Archon Basileus</span> served as the <span class="quote_inline">introducing official</span> (<span class="foreign">εἰσάγουσα ἀρχη</span>), but it seems that he did not actually participate in deciding the case; only the actual members of the Areopagus voted (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.4</span>). Because members of the Areopagus had all served as <span class="term">archons</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.22</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 60.3</span>), and because, as <span class="term">archons</span>, they would each have had experience presiding over the various courts of Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 56.6-7</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.2-4</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 58.2</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 59.2-6</span>), and because they served on the Areopagus for life (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3.6</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.11</span>), they must have had much more experience than the <span class="term">juries</span> of the other <span class="term">courts</span>.
</div>
<p>According to Aristotle, the Areopagus did not allow speakers, either defendants or prosecutors, to introduce irrelevant information into their speeches; in this, he says, the Areopagus is different from the other <span class="term">courts</span> at Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Rh.</span> 1354a 20</span>).
</p>
<p>If a speaker were to be accused of perjury (<span class="foreign">ψευδομαρτυρία</span>) before the Areopagus, he would not be prosecuted by the Areopagus itself, but by the <span class="term">Thesmothetae</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 59.6</span>).

<div class="Section" id="Homicide"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">The 4th c.: Intentional Homicide</span></h2>


<div class="p">In the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>, the Areopagus was responsible for trying cases of the most serious crimes. Aristotle says: <span class="quote_inline">Trials for deliberate murder and wounding are held in the Areopagus, and for causing death by poison, and for arson</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.22</span>). Other kinds of murder—involuntary homicide, conspiracy to murder, murder of a slave, resident alien, or foreign—were tried at the <span class="term">Palladium</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.3</span>). Still other kinds of murder—when the accused claimed that the killing was legal, as a matter of self-defense or in a case of adultery, or if someone accidentally killed a fellow citizen in war or during an athletic competition—were tried at the <span class="term">Delphinium</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.3</span>). In the case of adultery, the orator Lysias says that <blockquote class="quote"><p>the Court of the Areopagus itself, to which has been assigned, in our own as in our fathers’ time, the trial of suits for murder, has expressly stated that whoever takes this vengeance on an adulterer caught in the act with his spouse shall not be convicted of murder</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 1.30</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">But, as Demosthenes says, the Areopagus was the <span class="quote_inline">guard</span> (<span class="foreign">φύλαξ</span>) against <span class="quote_inline">vengeful murder</span> (<span class="foreign">οἱ περὶ ἀλλήλους φόνοι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.157</span>).</div>

<p>Elsewhere, Demosthenes describes the mythological origins of this function of the Court of the Areopagus, claiming that once upon a time the god Ares was put on trial for the murder of Halirrothius, the son of Poseidon; the hill was named after this event—the ‘Hill of Ares’—and the council that met on that hill enjoyed jurisdiction over homicide ever since (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.66</span>; see below for more sources for the mythological history of the Areopagus).
</p>
<p>The Areopagus also heard cases of assault and wounding (<span class="foreign">τραῦμα</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 40.32</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.22</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.93</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.3</span>). The Areopagus did not merely punish the assailants themselves, but also had the power to punish accessories. Demosthenes mentions a case of assault where the Areopagus exiled a man for encouraging the assailant; the defendant in this case was the father of the priestess of Artemis at Brauron, and therefore an important Athenian, but punished as an accessory nevertheless (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 54.25</span>).
</p>
<div class="p">According to Demosthenes, not only did the Areopagus permit (<span class="foreign">δίδωσε</span>) Athenians to bring cases of homicide before it for judgement, but actually required it (<span class="foreign">κελεύει</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.67</span>). Demosthenes himself was fined by the Areopagus, according to Aeschines, for failing to pursue a charge of assault (<span class="foreign">τραῦμα</span>) against his cousin Demomeles (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.93</span>). Aeschines goes on to claim that Demosthenes had actually wounded himself and falsely accused his cousin (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.15</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.93</span>), but regardless of that complication, Aeschines’ comment suggests that once there was an accusation of a crime over which the Areopagus had jurisdiction, the accuser was obliged to bring the matter to court. Demosthenes also describes how a certain Theocrines, whose brother was murdered, threatened to bring the case before the Areopagus, but dropped the matter when the murderer paid him money (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 58.29</span>)—the fact that Theocrines did this proves, according to Demosthenes, that he is a <span class="quote_inline">wretch and false accuser</span> (<span class="foreign">πονερὸς καὶ συκοφάντης</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 58.27</span>).
</div>
<p>The members of the Areopagus, the Areopagites, also seem to have investigated murders and assaults personally. In a speech prosecuting Conon, Demosthenes says that it was possible for members of the Areopagus to come to the bedside of a victim of assault, because if the victim should eventually die, they would have to try the case of his murder (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 54.28</span>).
</p>
<div class="p">It was a very serious matter to be charged with a crime before the Areopagus. In a speech written by Demosthenes for a client the speaker describes how his enemies plotted against him: <blockquote class="quote"><p> When they have thus openly laid a plot, and got up a charge against me before the Areopagus, do you suppose there is any poisoning or any other such villainy from which they would abstain?</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 40.57</span>). This passage compares being charged before the Areopagus with being poisoned, and gives us an idea of how serious such a charge was. Elsewhere in that same speech, the speaker explains that his enemies hoped that by charging him before the Areopagus, he would go into exile rather than risk conviction (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 40.32</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">According to the rules of procedure, a defendant charged before the Areopagus had the option of leaving the city rather than see the trial to its conclusion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 23.69</span>). If the defendant left, then his property was sold off by the <span class="quote_inline">Venders</span> (<span class="foreign">οἱ πωληταί</span>), after the <span class="term">Nine Archons</span> gave their approval for the sale (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.

<div class="p">Among the serious crimes that fell to the Areopagus were certain kinds of sacrilege. One example we know of had to do with a woman who had served as a priestess for the <span class="term">festival</span> of <span class="term">Athensteria</span>, in honor of the god Dionysus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.78</span>). In this case, the woman was married to an Athenian named Theogenes, and it became known that she was not herself properly an Athenian citizen (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.81</span>). The matter was investigated by the Areopagus, <span class="quote_inline">which in other matters also is of high worth to the city in what pertains to piety</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.80</span>). According to Apollodorus, the Areopagus was initially inclined to impose <span class="quote_inline">the highest fine in its power</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐζημίου ὅσα κυρία ἐστιν</span>) on Theogenes for allowing his wife to serve as priestess under false pretenses (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.81</span>), but they relented because Theogenes convinced them that he had been deceived, and meant no harm (Theogenes immediately expelled his wife from his house) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.83</span>).
</div>
<p>An inscription from <span class="date">352</span> or <span class="date">351 BCE</span> records that the Assembly gave the Areopagus certain authority over the religious sanctuaries of Attica (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 204.16-33</span>; source for date, <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, p.291</span>).
</p>
<div class="p">The Areopagus had authority over the sacred olive trees of Attica as well. If anyone was accused of cutting down a sacred olive tree, he was tried before the Areopagus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 7.22</span>). Aristotle explains that the city of Athens collected the fruit from the olive trees and pressed it into oil, which would then be stored on the Acropolis or sold; if anyone dug up or cut down one of the trees, he would be tried by the Areopagus, and if he were found guilty, the penalty used to be death (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 60.1-2</span>). But, Aristotle continues, in his own time (the <span class="date">middle of the 4th century</span>), <span class="quote_inline">while the law still exists, such a trial has fallen out of use</span> (<span class="foreign">ὁ μὲν νόμος ἔστιν, ἡ δὲ κρίσις καταλέλυται</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.

Even in the <span class="date">early 4th century</span>, it seems that the penalty was not death, but exile and confiscation of property (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 7.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 7.32</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 7.41</span>).

<div class="Section" id="OtherPowers"><h2><span class="headingNumber">9. </span><span class="head">The 4th c.: Other Powers</span></h2>


<div class="p">In the <span class="date">latter part of the 4th century</span>, the Areopagus exercised other powers beyond its traditional role as a court. The Areopagus could be called on, by the <span class="term">Council</span> or the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, to investigate certain public matters and issue a report to the <span class="term">People</span>. In one case that we hear of, Timarchus passed a motion in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to have the Areopagus investigate and report on some dwellings that had been erected on the hill of the Pnyx (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.81</span>). A member of the Areopagus, Autolycus, gave the body’s report to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and in doing so reminded the assembled people that <span class="quote_inline">We Areopagites do not, men of Athens, either accuse or defend, for that is not our tradition</span> (<span class="foreign">ἡμεῖς μέντοι, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, οἱ Ἀρεοπαγῖται οὔτε κατηγοροῦμεν οὔτε ἀπολογούμεθα, οὐ γὰρ ἡμῖν πάτριόν ἐστιν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.83</span>).
</div>
<p>In the <span class="date">340s BCE</span> and later, during a series of crises between Athens and Macedonia, the Areopagus seems to have been given additional powers. <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Mogens Herman Hansen</span> points out a pattern in the ancient evidence for the powers of the Areopagus: in times of crisis the Areopagus gained more authority over Athenian governance (<span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, p.295</span>). We find the Areopagus gaining influence in <span class="date">508 BCE</span> during the first Persian invasion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 5.72</span>), in <span class="date">480</span> during the second Persian invastion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.

</p>
<p>So to understand the role that the Areopagus played in the development of Athenian democracy, we should look at the sources for the history of the Areopagus from the mythology surrounding its earliest functions to the late <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>.
</p>
<p>After surveying those historical sources, we will return to look at evidence for the Areopagus’ powers after <span class="date">338</span>.

</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Myth"><h2><span class="headingNumber">10. </span><span class="head">History: Myth</span></h2>


<div class="p">Demosthenes says: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Concerning that Court of the Areopagus I could relate a greater number of noble stories, in part traditional and legendary, in part certified by our own personal testimony, than could be told of any other tribunal. It is worth your while to listen to one or two of them by way of illustration. First, then, in ancient times, as we are told by tradition, in this court alone the gods condescended both to render and to demand satisfaction for homicide, and to sit in judgement upon contending litigants—Poseidon, according to the legend, deigning to demand justice from Ares on behalf of his son Halirrothius, and the Twelve Gods to adjudicate between the Eumenides and Orestes</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.65-66</span>). Pausanias says that the Areopagus, ‘Hill of Ares,’ was so named because of the trial of the god Ares—he also mentions the trial of Orestes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.28.5</span>). Orestes had killed his mother, Clytemnestra, and so was pursued by the Furies (also called the Erinyes, the ‘awful goddesses,’ or the Eumenides); according to myth, the matter ended with a trial, held on the Areopagus and presided over by the goddess Athene. This story forms the basis for Aeschylus’ tragedy, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">The <span class="titlem">Eumenides</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aesch. <span class="titlem">Eum.</span></span>). In addition to the trials of Ares and Orestes, Pausanias says that—at least in his day, during the <span class="date">2nd century CE</span>—there was an altar to Athene Areia, ‘Warlike Athene,’ on the Hill of the Areopagus, that was said to have been dedicated by Orestes upon his acquittal (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.28.5</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">This mythological background helped give the Areopagus, and the court that met there, its authority. Aristotle reports that when Autocles was arguing that a certain man was obliged to let his case be heard by the court, he made this argument: <span class="quote_inline">If the awful goddesses were content to stand trial before the Areopagus, should not Mixidemides?</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Rh.</span> 1398b 25</span>).

</div>

<div class="Section" id="Before5thC"><h2><span class="headingNumber">11. </span><span class="head">History: Before the 5th c.</span></h2>


<div class="p">According to Aristotle, under the <span class="quote_inline">government of Draco</span> (a figure for whom there is little good historical evidence, and whom we should probably assume to be largely mythical), <span class="quote_inline">the Council of the Areopagus was guardian of the laws, and kept a watch on the <span class="term">magistrates</span> to make them govern in acordance with the laws</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 4.4</span>). According to Plutarch, <span class="quote_inline">most writers</span> <span class="note" id="Note2"> [meaning, of course, most of the writers available to Plutarch in the <span class="date">2nd century CE</span>]</span> attribute the founding of the Areopagus to Solon, the Athenian reformer of the <span class="date">6th century BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.2</span>). But Plutarch reports a law, supposedly written by Solon, that mentions people condemned by the Areopagus earlier (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.3</span>). <blockquote class="quote"><p>This surely proves to the contrary that the council of the Areopagus was in existence before the achonship and legislation of Solon. For how could men have been condemned in the Areopagus before the time of Solon, if Solon was the first to give the council of the Areopagus its jurisdiction?</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.4</span>). Of course, Plutarch’s evidence does not ‘prove’ anything, since there is no guarantee that the law he quotes is authentic.
</div>
<div class="p">It seems that the Areopagus in the <span class="date">6th century</span> had broad authority. Aristotle mentions that during the reign of the tyrant Pisistratus (c. <span class="date">546-528</span> BCE <span class="note" id="Note3"> [source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OHCW</span></span>]</span>), the tyrant himself was summoned before the Areopagus on a charge of murder (he presented himself for trial, but his accuser failed to show up) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 16.8</span>). Aristotle also says that Solon, <blockquote class="quote"><p>appointed the Council of the Areopagus to the duty of guarding the laws, just as it had existed even before as overseer of the constitution, and it was this council that kept watch over the greatest and the most important of the affairs of state, in particular correcting offenders with sovereign powers both to fine and punish, and making returns of its expenditure to the Acropolis without adding a statement of the reason for the outlay, and trying persons that conspired to put down the democracy, Solon having laid down a law of <span class="term">impeachment</span> in regard to them</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.4</span>).
</div>
<p>The Areopagus seems to have consisted of former <span class="term">archons</span> from the earliest times (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3.6</span>), but the process of selecting <span class="term">archons</span> each year changed, which necessarily changed the nature of the Areopagus. Aristotle says that before Solon—in the <span class="date">early 6th century</span> (source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OHCW</span></span>)—the Areopagus itself chose the <span class="term">nine archons</span> each year (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.2</span>). Since by choosing <span class="term">archons</span> it was also choosing its own future members, the Areopagus would have been a very exclusive, and almost certainly aristocratic body. Solon’s reforms, according to Aristotle, included a change in the selection of <span class="term">archons</span>. Each tribe (<span class="foreign">φυλή</span>) would nominate (<span class="foreign">προκρίνειε</span>) ten candidates, and the <span class="term">nine archons</span> would then be chosen by random lot from these (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.2</span>). This procedure would have made the Areopagus somewhat more democratic.
</p>
<div class="p">The evidence we have, however, is not consistent. For example, in the <span class="titlem">Politics</span> Aristotle says that Solon <blockquote class="quote"><p>seemed to to avoid destroying the previously existing institutions, particularly the <span class="term">Council</span> and the selection of archons, but to establish democracy by instituting <span class="term">jury-courts</span> from all the citizens</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ἔοικε δὲ Σόλων ἐκεῖνα μὲν ὑπάρχοντα πρότερον οὐ καταλῦσαι, τήν τε βουλὴν καὶ τὴν τῶν ἀρχῶν αἵρεσιν, τὸν δὲ δῆμον καταστῆσαι, τὰ δικαστήρια ποιήσας ἐκ πάντων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1273b-1274a</span>). This seems to say that Solon did not change the way <span class="term">archons</span> were selected. The question remains open, but since <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.2</span> gives specific details, while <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1273b-1274a</span> speaks in very general terms, most historians accept the former, and conclude that Solon did, in fact, change how <span class="term">archons</span> were selected.
</div>
<div class="p">Aristotle also says that <blockquote class="quote"><p>in the archonship of Telesinus (<span class="date">487/6 BCE</span>; source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Rhodes, 272</span>), they elected the <span class="term">Nine Archons</span> by lot, tribe by tribe, from a preliminary list of five hundred chosen by the demes: this was the date of the first election on these lines after the tyranny, the previous <span class="term">Archons</span> having all been elected by vote</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.5</span>). This passage suggests that the tyrant Pisistratus (<span class="date">c. 546-</span><span class="date">528 BCE</span>, source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OHCW</span></span>) changed the method for selecting archons from random selection to some method over which he could exert control.
</div>
<p>Plutarch reports another ancient historian, Idomeneus (whose works do not survive) as saying that Aristides was chosen to be <span class="term">archon</span> by election, not by random lot, in <span class="date">489/8 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Arist.</span> 1.8</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Rhodes, 273</span>).
</p>
<div class="p">Here too, however, there is some evidence that would seem to contradict this statement. When the historian Herodotus narrates the battle of Marathon, which happened in <span class="date">490 BCE</span> (three years before the archonship of Telesinus in <span class="date">487/6</span>; source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OHCW</span></span>), he says that Callimachus of Aphidnae was <span class="term">polemarch</span> (i.e. one of the <span class="term">nine archons</span>), <span class="quote_inline">chosen by lot <span class="note" id="Note4"> [literally, ‘by bean’]</span> to be <span class="term">polemarch</span> of the Athenians</span> (<span class="foreign">ὁ τῷ κυάμῳ λαχὼν Ἀθηναίων πολεμαρξέειν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 6.109.2</span>). This, then, might be an example of an <span class="term">archon</span> being chosen by lot, rather than by election, three years earlier than <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.5</span> would have us believe. The historian N.G.L. Hammond has made an argument that would bring these two seemingly conflicting pieces of evidence together. He has suggested that before between the tyranny and <span class="date">487/6</span>, nine Athenians were elected to be <span class="term">archons</span>, but were assigned to individual functions by lot (<span class="bibl bibl-secondary">N.G.L. Hammond, <span class="titlem">JHS</span> 88 (1968) 50, with n. 145</span>). So, we would then read <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 6.109.2</span> as meaning that Callimachus of Aphidnae had been elected to be one of the <span class="term">nine archons</span>, but had been assigned to be <span class="term">polemarch</span> by lot.
</div>
<p>Despite these problems of contradictory evidence, it seems clear that by the <span class="date">early years of the 5th century</span>, the <span class="term">nine archons</span> were chosen by lot, rather than by election.

<div class="Section" id="Reforms"><h2><span class="headingNumber">12. </span><span class="head">History: Reforms of the early 5th c.</span></h2>


<p>For the first good evidence for the Areopagus as a political institution in Athens, we must wait until the <span class="date">5th century BCE</span>, when the Council of the Areopagus became one focus of attention as pro- and anti-democratic factions worked to shape the government of Athens. The most important historical figures for this stage of the Areopagus’ history are Themistocles, Cimon, Ephialtes, and Pericles. Cimon and Ephialtes were at the focus of the most significant reform of the Council of the Areopagus.
</p>
<div class="p">Aristotle describes the history of the early development of the Athenian democracy in terms of historical figures who held positions of leadership among the Athenian people. Wherever possible, he groups these into pairs, with one person representing the movement toward increasing democracy, and one representing the opposition to democracy: <blockquote class="quote"><p>For Solon was the first and original head of the <span class="term">People</span>, and the second was Pisistratus, who was one of the men of nobility and note. After the tyranny had been put down, Cleisthenes, a member of the family of the Alcmaeonidae, was head of the <span class="term">People</span>, and he had no opponent, since the party of Isagoras was banished; but after this Xanthippus held the headship of the <span class="term">People</span>, and Miltiades of the notables; and then Themistocles and Aristides; and after them Ephialtes held the headship of the <span class="term">People</span>, and Cimon son of Miltiades of the wealthy; and then Pericles of the <span class="term">People</span> and Thucydides of the others, he being a relation of Cimon</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 28.2</span>). Elsewhere in the ‘<span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span>,’ Aristotle returns to this schematic outline of Athenian history, this time identifying important reforms to the government of Athens and associating those reforms with prominent historical figures. The first three he mentions are more-or-less mythical—Ion’s settlement of Attica, Theseus’ kingship, Draco’s original code of laws. Then followed Solon’s legislation, the tyranny of Pisistratus, and Cleisthenes’ democratic reforms. <blockquote class="quote"><p>Sixth the reform after the <span class="term">Persian War</span>, under the superintendence of the Council of the Areopagus. Seventh followed the reform outlined by Aristides but completed by Ephialtes when he put down the Council of the Areopagus.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.2</span>; the subsequent reforms were the oligarchy of the <span class="date">late 5th century</span>, its overthrow, the <span class="term">Tyranny of the Thirty</span>, and the subsequent restoration of democracy).
</div>
<p>For our immediate purposes, the most interesting of these is the one Aristotle mentions as being sixth after the settlement of Attica, the reforms of Ephialtes.
</p>
<p>During the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, and particularly the Persians’ invasion of Athens in <span class="date">480 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OHCW</span></span>), the Areopagus took a leading role in organizing, and paying for, the evacuation of all Athenians from the Attica to Salamis and the Peloponnese; this public service from the ancient institution raised the prestige of the Areopagus (which had suffered some once <span class="term">archons</span> were elected randomly, rather than by election) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 23.1</span>). Aristotle goes on to say that the Areopagus enjoyed preeminence in Athens for almost two decades, until the time when Conon was <span class="term">archon</span>, and Ephialtes brought about his reforms in <span class="date">462 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.1</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3 <span class="term">s.v.</span> ‘Demosthenes’</span>).
</p>
<div class="p">Ephialtes was the son of Sophonides (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.77.6</span>). Aelian includes him in a list of important public figures who were not rich (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Ael. VH 2.43</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Ael.

Aelian also calls Ephialtes a <span class="quote_inline">philosopher</span>, but what that is supposed to mean is not clear (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Ael. VH 3.17</span>).
</div>
<p>Ephialtes seems to have held the position of <span class="term">strategos</span> (<span class="foreign">στρατηγός</span>), or <span class="term">General</span>, at Athens, since we hear of him commanding an Athenian fleet in the Aegean, shortly after Cimon’s victories over Persia in <span class="date">467</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 13.5</span>; source for date, <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>).
</p>
<div class="p">Apart from these few details, most of what we know about Ephialtes has to do with his greatest political triumph, the reform of the Areopagus. Diodorus Siculus, who is critical of the reform, summarizes the event and adds a ‘moral,’ saying that Ephialtes <blockquote class="quote"><p>persuaded the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to vote to curtail the power of the Council of the Areopagus and to destroy the renowned customs which their fathers had followed. Nevertheless, he did not escape the punishment for attempting such lawlessness, but he was done to death by night and none ever knew how he lost his life</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.77.6</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">The ancient sources are not consistent regarding who was responsible for the reform of the Areopagus. Aristotle’s <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span>, for example, mentions Ephialtes alone at one point (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.1</span>), Ephialtes and Themistocles elsewhere (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.3</span>-4), and Pericles elsewhere (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 27.1</span>). Plutarch also gives credit to Pericles (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.3</span>), but his description of events helps straighten out the confusion and point to Ephialtes as the man responsible for the reforms themselves: <blockquote class="quote"><p>For this reason all the more did Pericles, strong in the affections of the <span class="term">people</span>, lead a successful party against the Council of the Areopagus. <em>Not only was the Council robbed of most of its jurisdiction by</em> Ephialtes, but Cimon also, on the charge of being a lover of Sparta and a hater of the <span class="term">people</span>, was <span class="term">ostracized</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.4</span>) <span class="note" id="Note5"> [emphasis added]</span>. Elsewhere in his biography of Pericles, Plutarch refers to Ephialtes as the one <span class="quote_inline">who broke down the power of the Council of the Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 7.6</span>). According to Plutarch, then, Pericles may have been an important influence behind the events, but it was Ephialtes who actually brought about the reforms (see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1274a</span>, which seems to agree with Plutarch’s version, and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.77.6</span>, which mentions Ephialtes only).

<div class="Section" id="CimonAndThemistocles"><h2><span class="headingNumber">13. </span><span class="head">History: Cimon and Themistocles</span></h2>


<p>In the years following the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, which ended in <span class="date">479 BCE</span> (source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>), the principle advocate of a less democratic, more restricted government was Cimon, the son of Miltiades (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 4.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.7</span>). Themistocles was a leading advocate of democratic reforms, and Ephialtes seems to have been his successor in this role, after Themistocles was <span class="term">ostracized</span> in <span class="date">472 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Them.</span> 22.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.6</span>-8; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>).
</p>
<p>In the years before Ephialtes enacted his reforms, both Cimon and Themistocles stood trial before the Court of the Areopagus, and these trials provide an interesting background to Ephialtes’ reforms.
</p>
<p>By <span class="date">467 BCE</span>, while the Persians had been mostly driven from the Aegean sea, they remained in the Chersonese, a peninsula in the northern Aegean, and allied themselves with some of the people of Thrace; the Athenians dispatched Cimon to wage war against them (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 14.1</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). Cimon won a victory in Thrace, which would have allowed him, had he wished to, to invade Macedonia. When he failed to do this, he was brought to trial in Athens, accused of accepting bribes to leave Macedonia alone; one of the prosecutors at his trial was Pericles (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 14.2</span>-3). Cimon spoke well in his own defense (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 14.3</span>) and was acquitted, but this trial, at least as Plutarch narrates Cimon’s career, marked the beginning of a period of confrontation between him and the democratic reformers (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 15.1</span>-2; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.7</span>).
</p>
<p>Themistocles was himself a member of the Court of the Areopagus, but was <span class="term">ostracized</span> at the end of the <span class="date">470s BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Them.</span> 22.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.135</span>). While he was in exile, the Court of the Areopagus tried him for treason—the charge was ‘Medism,’ or conspiring with Persia—and condemned him to death, although he was absent (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.138</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Them.</span> 22.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.3</span>). According to Aristotle, Themistocles encouraged Ephialtes to limit the powers of the Court of the Areopagus in order to forestall his own prosecution (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.3</span>-4). This directly contradicts all other sources, who make it clear that Themistocles was not, in fact, in Athens at the time of his trial (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.135</span>-138; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Them.</span> 22.1</span>), but it might suggest that the trial of Themistocles, a famous advocate of democratic reform, influenced Ephialtes.
</p>
<p>Cause and effect in history, ancient or modern, are difficult to establish, but we can say this: when Ephialtes enacted his reforms that limited the powers of the Court of the Areopagus, thus making Athens more democratic (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 27.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 7.6</span>), that court had recently acquitted a famous opponent of democracy and had condemned a famous proponent of democracy.
</p>
<p>In the year <span class="date">462</span>, Cimon led an Athenian army to the Peloponnese to help Sparta put down a rebellion, a mission that Ephialtes had opposed (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 16.8</span>). Ephialtes seems to have taken advantage of his absence to enact democratic reforms, especially a reform in the powers and authority of the Court of the Areopagus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 15.1</span>-2; for a full discussion of the circumstances of Cimon’s absence, and the timing of Ephialtes’ reforms, see the article on Cimon). Upon Cimon’s return, he was <span class="term">ostracized</span> for ten years (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 17.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.4</span>).

</div>

<div class="Section" id="EphialtesReforms"><h2><span class="headingNumber">14. </span><span class="head">History: Areopagus and the Demos</span></h2>


<div class="p">According to Aristotle, Ephialtes brought about a reform of the Court of the Areopagus by denouncing the Court before the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="foreign">τῆς βουλῆς τῶν πεντακοσίων</span>) and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐν τῷ δήμῳ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.4</span>). So the reform was not, finally, the work of Ephialtes alone, but an act of legislation by two of the more democratic institutions in Athens. Aristotle connects this event to a newfound feeling of power among the common <span class="term">people</span> of Athens following the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, when the less wealthy citizens by serving in the navy had saved the city. He makes the connection between naval victories and the reform of the Court of the Areopagus explicitly in his Politics (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1274a</span>), and the <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span> strongly suggests the connection as well: <blockquote class="quote"><p>For he took away some of the functions of the Areopagus, and he urged the state very strongly in the direction of naval power, which resulted in emboldening the <span class="term">multitude</span>, who brought all the government more into their own hands.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 27.1</span>; note that <span class="quote_inline">he</span> in this quotation is Pericles, but as we have seen this work attributes these reforms to Ephialtes and Pericles, as does the <span class="titlem">Politics</span>; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1274a</span>).
</div>
<p>By <span class="date">462 BCE</span>, when Ephialtes made his reforms, the <span class="term">archons</span> (the future members of the Court of the Areopagus) were chosen by lot, not by vote (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.5</span>). It is possible that this change made the institution seem less prestigious, and thus worthy of holding fewer powers <span class="note" id="Note6"> [This interesting suggestion is from <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">P.J.

<div class="Section" id="MoreEphialtes"><h2><span class="headingNumber">15. </span><span class="head">History: Ephialtes’ Reforms</span></h2>


<div class="p">By means of Ephialtes’ reforms, according to Aristotle, <span class="quote_inline">the Council of the Areopagus was deprived of the superintendence of affairs. After this there came about an increased relaxation of the constitution</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 26.1</span>). A fragment from Philochorus, who was a historian writing in the <span class="date">3rd century BCE</span>, offers a little more detail. In his description of the <span class="term">nomophylakes</span>, or <span class="quote_inline">guardians of the laws</span> (<span class="foreign">νομοφύλακες</span>), he says: <span class="quote_inline">There were seven of them, and they were established when Ephialtes left to the Council of the Areopagus only those cases pertaining to the body</span> (<span class="foreign">ἑπτὰ δὲ ἦσαν καὶ κατέστησαν, ὡς Φιλόχορος, ὅτε Ἐφιάλτης μόνα κατέλιπε τῇ ἐξ Ἀρείου πάγου βουλῇ τὰ ὑπὲρ τοῦ σώματος</span>) (<span class="bibl">Philoch. fr. 64</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">To understand what Aristotle means by <span class="quote_inline">deprived of superintendence of affairs</span>, or what Philochorus means by <span class="quote_inline">only those cases pertaining to the body</span> we can only look at comments in the sources about the Court of the Areopagus’ role after Ephialtes’ reforms. Aristotle, describing the Court of the Areopagus and its functions in <span class="date">the middle of the 4th century BCE</span> (over a century after Ephialtes’ reforms), says that this court had authority over trials of murder, wounding, death by poison, and arson, but that other similar crimes—involuntary manslaughter, murder of slaves or foreigners, accidental killings, or killings in self-defense—come before other <span class="term">courts</span>, the <span class="term">Court of the Palladium</span> or the <span class="term">Court of the Delphinium</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.3</span>). A law quoted in a speech by Demosthenes agrees (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.22</span>); but it is important to remember that laws quoted in speeches may have been added to the manuscript later, sometime centuries later.
</div>
<div class="p">If Ephialtes’ reforms took many crimes out of the jurisdiction of the Court of the Areopagus and assigned them to other <span class="term">courts</span>, with <span class="term">juries</span> of citizens, then there would have been a greater need for citizens to serve on <span class="term">juries</span>. And, in fact, several of the accounts of Ephialtes and Pericles reforming the Court of the Areopagus also mention the institution of pay for <span class="term">jury</span> service, an innovation that may have aimed at meeting this new need. Aristotle relates the two reforms very closely, and relates them both to an increasingly democratic government: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Ephialtes and Pericles docked the power of the Council on the Areopagus, while Pericles instituted payment for serving in the <span class="term">law-courts</span>, and in this manner finally the successive leaders of the <span class="term">people</span> led them on by growing stages to the present democracy</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1274a</span>; also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.

<div class="Section" id="ThirtyTyrants"><h2><span class="headingNumber">16. </span><span class="head">History: The Later 5th c.</span></h2>


<div class="p">The next watershed in the history of the Areopagus was the period of the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>. In <span class="date">404 BCE</span>, when Athens had been defeated by Sparta after twenty seven years of war, the democracy at Athens was temporarily overthrown and a new, oligarchic government took its place (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.3.1</span>). This government was to last only a year (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.4.39</span>), but marks an important break in the development of the Athenian democracy. According to Xenophon, the government was to consist of <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>, <span class="quote_inline">who would collect the ancestral laws and govern according to them</span> (<span class="foreign">οἳ τοὺς πατρίους νόμους συγγράψουσι, καθ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??οὓς πολιτεύσουσι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.3.1</span>). This had an immediate effect on the institution of the Areopagus: <blockquote class="quote"><p>At first they were moderate towards the citizens and pretended to be administering the ancestral form of constitution, and they removed from the Areopagus the laws of Ephialtes and Archestratus about the Areopagites</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 35.2</span>; we should note that this Archestratus is not mentioned by any other source). With the reforms of the <span class="date">early 5th century</span> annulled, the Areopagus would presumably return to being the powerful and aristocratic body it has once been.
</div>
<div class="p">The tyranny of the <span class="term">Thirty</span> was overthrown in the next year (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.4.39</span>), and the democracy was restored. It is interesting to note, however, that the prestige of the Areopagus was undiminished, despite the body’s having been one focus of the tyrants’ government. The orator Andocides describes how the tyranny was overthrown and how the Athenians drew up a temporary constitution to govern the city during the time of confusion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1</span>). Included in this speech is a <span class="term">decree</span>, supposedly passed by the <span class="term">Assembly</span> in <span class="date">403</span>. In this decree, it is obvious how intently the Athenians were returning to democratic principles, and it is also obvious that they still regarded the Areopagus as a vital part of their government; the decree lists various laws and provisions, and concludes: <blockquote class="quote"><p>The laws thus handed over, however, shall be submitted beforehand to the scrutiny of the <span class="term">Council</span> and the five hundred <span class="term">Nomothetae</span> elected by the Demes, when they have taken their oath. Further, any private citizen who so desires may come before the <span class="term">Council</span> and suggest improvements in the laws. When the laws have been ratified, they shall be placed under the guardianship of the Council of the Areopagus, to the end that only such laws as have been ratified may be applied by <span class="term">magistrates</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.84</span>; source for date, <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). According to this decree, the <span class="term">People</span> (in the form of the <span class="term">Council</span>, the <span class="term">Nomothetae</span>, and the Demes) enacted laws, and any private citizen individually could suggest emendations, but the Areopagus was to guard the laws. Notice also, that the decree is careful to note that the ‘<span class="term">magistrates</span>’ (<span class="foreign">αἰ ἀρξαί</span>) can enact only those laws that have been approved by this democratic process.

<p>The first part of this article on the Areopagus describes its composition, procedures, and powers in the period following the overthrow of the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>. It is for this period, the <span class="date">first two-thirds of the 4th century BCE</span>, for which we have the best evidence, both the body of Oratory, and the Aristotelian <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span></span>). The sections that follow describe some special functions that seem to have fallen under the control of the Areopagus during the <span class="date">4th century</span>, functions apart from its role as a court for homicide and impiety.

</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="TimesOfTrouble"><h2><span class="headingNumber">18. </span><span class="head">A Rock in Times of Trouble</span></h2>


<div class="p">We have already seen that the Areopagus played an important role in evacuating Athens during the Persian Invasion at <span class="date">the beginning of the 5th century BCE</span>, both by using its authority to organize the evacuation, and by using its members’ wealth to help pay for the evacuation (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 23.1</span>). In the <span class="date">4th century</span>, we see the Areopagus acting decisively in another time of national crisis. In <span class="date">338 BCE</span>, the Athenians and the Thebans, with some other allied states, tried to oppose Philip of Macedon’s growing power; the climactic battle was fought at Chaeronea in Boeotia, and was a terrible defeat for Athens (the battle is narrated by Diodorus Siculus, beginning at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 16.84</span>; source for date, <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OHCW</span></span>). The orators Aeschines and Lycurgus describe how, in the aftermath of that battle, the Areopagus prosecuted people for fleeing Athens during this crisis. Aeschines says, <blockquote class="quote"><p>There came—it pains me to call it to mind repeatedly—there came a certain disaster to the city. At that time a certain private citizen who merely undertook to sail to Samos was on the same day punished with death by the Council of the Areopagus, as a traitor to his country. Another private citizen, who sailed away to Rhodes, was only the other day prosecuted, because he was a coward in the face of danger.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.252</span>). When Lycurgus mentions these events in his prosecution of Leocrates, he pauses to assure his audience that he means no criticism of the Areopagus; in this passage, the orator is arguing that since some other Athenians were punished for fleeing the city, Leocrates ought to be punished as well: <blockquote class="quote"><p>You should bear in mind, gentlemen, that it is not even in your power, unless you go beyond your rights, to acquit this man Leocrates, since his offence has had judgement passed upon it and a vote of condemnation too. For the council of the Areopagus—No one need interrupt me. That council was, in my opinion, the greatest bulwark of the city at the time—seized and executed men who then had fled from their country and abandoned it to the enemy. You must not think, gentlemen, that these councillors who are so scrupulous in trying other men for homicide would themselves have taken the life of any citizen unlawfully. Moreover you condemned Autolycus and punished him because, though he himself had faced the dangers, he was charged with secretly sending his wife and sons away. Yet if you punished him when his only crime was that he had sent away persons useless for war, what should your verdict be on one who, though a man, did not pay his country the price of his nurture? The people also, who looked with horror upon what was taking place, decreed that those who were evading the danger which their country’s defence involved were liable for treason, meriting in their belief the extreme penalty</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lyc. 1.52-53</span>; for the trial of Autolycus, see <span class="bibl">Lyc. Fr. 9</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">As it did when the Persians invaded, it seems that after the defeat at Chaeronea, the Areopagus was acting to preserve the strength of Athens in a time of crisis. And so Lycurgus calls the Areopagus <span class="quote_inline">the greatest salvation of the city at the time</span> (<span class="foreign">μεγίστην τότε γενέσθαι τῇ πόλει σωτηρίαν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lyc. 1.52</span>).

<div class="p">After the battle of Chaeronea, <span class="date">338 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OHCW</span></span>), we find some evidence for the Areopagus overriding certain decisions made by the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. Plutarch says that after Chaeronea, when the <span class="term">Assembly</span> elected Charidemus to be one of the ten <span class="term">Generals</span>, the Areopagus overruled that decision and appointed Phocion in his place; this passage shows Plutarch’s anti-democratic bias: <blockquote class="quote"><p>When the defeat <span class="note" id="Note7"> [at Chaeronea]</span> had happened, and when the rabble-rousers and radicals in the city had dragged Charidemus up to the platform and pronounced him worthy of being <span class="term">General</span>, the upper-classes (<span class="foreign">οἱ βέλτιστοι</span>) grew afraid, and since the Council of the Areopagus was in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, by begging and weeping they persuaded the Areopagus to put the city into the hands of Phocion</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">γενομένης δὲ τῆς ἥττης, καὶ τῶν θορυβοποιῶν καὶ νεωτεριστῶν ἐν ἄστει τὸν Χαρίδημον ἑλκόντων ἐπὶ τὸ βῆμα καὶ στρατηγεῖν ἀξιούντων, ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ βέλτιστοι, καὶ τὴν ἐξ Ἀρείου πάγου βουλὴν ἔχοντες ἐν τῷ δήμῳ, δεόμενοι καὶ δακρύοντες μόλις ἔπεισαν ἐπιτρέψαι τῷ Φωκίωνι τὴν πόλιν.</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Phoc.</span> 16.4</span>).
</div>
<div class="p">Demosthenes also recounts a series of events in which the Areopagus seems to intervene twice in matters already decided by the <span class="term">People</span>. The orator describes how Antiphon, who had been in exile from Athens, was caught in the city, but Aeschines defended him before the people (presumably in the <span class="term">People’s Court</span>) and won acquittal (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.132</span>). Demosthenes goes on to say that, <blockquote class="quote"><p>Had not the Council of the Areopagus, becoming aware of the facts, and seeing that you had made a most inopportune blunder, started further inquiries, arrested the man, and brought him into court a second time, the vile traitor would have slipped out of your hands and eluded justice, being smuggled out of the city by our bombastic phrase-monger</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.133</span>). The <span class="quote_inline">bombastic phrase-monger</span> (<span class="foreign">σεμνολόγου τουτουί</span>) to whom Demosthenes refers is his opponent Aeschines. Demosthenes then goes on to say that after this event, in which the Areopagus overturned a verdict from the <span class="term">People’s Court</span>, they overturned a decision by the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, which had chosen Aeschines to serve as an Athenian ambassador for a special mission; the Areopagus <span class="quote_inline">promptly rejected him as a traitor, and gave the mission to Hyperides</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.134</span>).

<p>In the <span class="date">4th century</span> we also find evidence for the Areopagus conducting special investigations. For example, Aeschines mentions the Areopagus appearing before the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to report on some dwelling houses on the Pnyx (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.81</span>). This may have been a function of the Council of the Areopagus for some time, since according to a speech by Dinarchus (delivered in <span class="date">323 BCE</span>), Demosthenes had requested that the Areopagus investigate a matter of bribery "as was its traditional right" (<span class="foreign">ὡς αὐτῇ πάτριόν ἐστι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.4</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, p. 292</span>). But after the <span class="date">340s BCE</span>, the evidence starts to refer to a specific kind of investigation, one that involved the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, the Areopagus, and the <span class="term">People’s Court</span>; evidence for this kind of investigation, known as ‘<span class="term">apophasis</span>’ (<span class="foreign">ἀπόφασις</span>; for example at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.62</span>) is described in a separate article (see <span class="term">Apophasis</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, p.292</span>). </p>
