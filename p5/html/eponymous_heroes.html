 </a>The <span class="term">Cleisthenic</span> reforms of <span class="date">508/7</span>, which firmly established democracy at Athens, imposed a new division of Attica into ten tribes, each of which constituted a new political and
 military unit, but included citizens from each of the three geographical regions of
 Attica—the city, the coast, and the
 inland. Enrollment in a tribe (according to heredity) was a mandatory prerequisite for
 <span class="term">citizenship</span>.</p>
 <p>As usual in ancient Athenian affairs, politics and religion came hand in hand and, after
 due consultation with Apollo’s oracle at Delphi, each new tribe was assigned to a particular hero after
 whom the tribe was named; the ten tribal heroes are thus known as the eponymous (or name
 giving) heroes.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="GroupHistory"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">The tribal heroes as a group: history</span></h2>
 
 <p>Aristotle indicates that each hero already received
 worship by the time of the <span class="term">Cleisthenic</span> reforms,
 although little evidence as to the nature of the worship of each hero is now known (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 21.6</span>).
 Even if the locus of their individual cults is obscure, each hero may be identified,
 according to his mythology, with a particular part of Attica (e.g. Ajax of Salamis). Tribal documents seem to have been deposited at the local shrine
 of each hero, as well as by the statue of the relevant hero in the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/architindex?lookup=Athens,+Eponymous+Heroes">Monument of the Eponymous Heroes</a> at the Agora in Athens.</p>
 <p>The concept of an eponymous hero was an established tradition before the reforms of Cleisthenes; the four Ionian tribes, for example, were said by
 Herodotus to have been named after the sons of Ion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt.
 5.66</span>). And the reverence of a hero whose name might be similar or identical to
 the name of the place where s/he was worshipped is an ancient mode of thought that by the
 classical period comes quite close to the concept of personification—the
 representation of a thing, place, or abstraction as a person or by the human
 form—so that in many cases it is impossible to determine whether the hero was
 named for the place or <span class="term">vice versa</span>. Either way, however, through the
 democratic era, each eponymous hero came to be so closely identified with his tribe that
 his figure served to represent that group of people in a political sense. In the Agora—the market and political center of
 Athens—the heroes were commemorated (and
 worshipped?) together at the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/architindex?lookup=Athens,+Eponymous+Heroes">Monument of the Eponymous Heroes</a>, attested as early as <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Peace</span> 1183</span>, but
 enshrined in its current form—east of the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/architindex?lookup=Athens,+Metroon">Metroon</a> on the west side of the Agora—in the <span class="date">340s</span> or <span class="date">330s</span>.</p>

 <div class="Section" id="GroupMythology"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">The tribal heroes as a group: mythology</span></h2>
 
 <p>Just as politics and religion were inextricably entwined at Athens, so were myth and history, which together served to support
 political and/or religious institutions. So it is no surprise that in a funeral oration
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Ps.-Dem. 60.27ff</span> chooses first to
 praise the heroism of the deceased and then to connect some small fragment from the
 mythology of each tribal hero with the courage and patriotism of the fallen warriors. Thus
 the frequent appearance of the heroes—individually and particularly
 together—in mythological contexts dating to the era of the Democracy (from <span class="date">508 down to 322</span>)—whether as tragic characters
 on the stage or figures ornamenting vases may be considered politically motivated. Just as
 personifications symbolize places, institutions, and abstractions, the roles of the
 eponymous heroes in visual as well as the literary arts—whether or not in
 mythological contexts—is as symbols of the tribes with which they shared their
 names. Whether to patriotic tribesmen or to (dis)interested others, they advertise their
 tribes. It is unsurprising, therefore, that the heroes are always shown in a good light in
 Athenian visual arts.</p>

 <p>Mythology: <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1990.11.0094">
 
 </a>Ajax, son of Telamon and of

 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hom. <span class="titlem">Il.</span> 2.257</span>,
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">7.199</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 5.66</span>). His genealogy is further
 discussed by archaic and classical authors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hunt.</span> 1.9</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.42.4</span>, and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Pind.

 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 10</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 6.35.4</span>), and his role as a
 warrior at Troy (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hom. <span class="titlem">Il.</span> 2.557</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Soph. <span class="titlem">Aj.</span> 861</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hom. <span class="titlem">Od.</span>
 11.543-60</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 8.64</span>). </p>
 <p>Worship: Ajax was worshipped primarily at his home, Salamis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.35.3-4</span> notes a temple
 with an ebony statue) but also at Athens proper
 (probably in the Eurysakeion in Melite, for which see <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">Hesperia</span> 7 [1938] 18, 94 no. 15</span>; this may be the sanctuary
 recorded in two inscriptions: <span class="bibl">Agora I 286</span> and <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span>
 II2, 1008.87</span>). Pausanias
 also mentions a Megarian cult of Athena Aiantis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus.

 )</p>
 <p>Mythology: <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1993.01.0664">
 
 </a>Aigeus was said to be the son of Pandion or Skyrios (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Apollod. 3.15.5</span>), or perhaps was
 adopted by Pandion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span> 13.1</span>) and,
 despite several marriages (to Meta [Melite?] and Chalkiope), remained childless until he
 slept with Aithra (who subsequently bore Theseus) at Troizen (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Apollod. 3.15.7</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span> 3.5</span>). He later
 married Medea (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Eur. <span class="titlem">Med.</span> 1384 ff.</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod.
 <span class="titlem">Epit.</span> 1.5</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus.
 2.3.8</span>), then was reunited with his son, Theseus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span> 12.2-6</span>),
 and leapt to his death by jumping off the Acropolis when he saw black sails on Theseus’ ship (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus.
 1.22.5</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 4.61.7</span>). </p>
 <p>Worship: Aigeus received a <span class="titlem">heroon</span> (that is, a
 hero-shrine) at Athens, according to <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.22.5</span> (supported by <span class="bibl">Harpocration <span class="titlem">s.v.</span>
 ‘Aigeion’</span>); this may have been at the Delphinion, where he was said to live (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span> 12.6</span>), or the
 Sanctuary of Aphrodite
 Ourania, which he founded on account of his childlessness,
 according to <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.14.7</span>.</p>
 <p>Tribal connection: The only tribal detail relevant to Aigeus
 that is known to have been recorded is that Aigeus’
 priest was chosen from among the tribesman of the Aigeis tribe (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2, 952</span>). </p>

 <p>Mythology: <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1992.06.0620">
 
 </a>Akamas was a son of Theseus,

 17 Kinkel</span>, <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">Iliupersis</span> fr. 3 K</span>). His maternity was
 disputed, however (his mother is said to be Phaidra [<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 4.62</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. <span class="titlem">Epit.</span> 1.18</span>], Ariadne
 [<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">Schol.</span> Hom. <span class="titlem">Od.</span> 11.321</span>], or Antiope, by association). He is associated with colonisations in
 the Chersonnese (with Antimachos: <span class="bibl"><span class="term">Sch.</span> Thuc. 1.11</span>), at
 Cyprus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Strab. 6.83</span>; with Phaleros: <span class="bibl">Lycophron 494

 <p>Worship: Akamas’ tribal shrine was at Kallithea (Xypete or

 13354/Athens</span>, <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">EM</span> 13354a</span> (ca. <span class="date">361/0</span>).

 <p>Mythology: <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1990.14.0213">
 
 </a>Antiochos was a son of Herakles
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Ps.-Dem. 60.31</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.8.3</span>) and Meda (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.5.2</span>). The descendants of his
 son Phylas led the return of the Heracleidae (according to <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus.
 2.4.3</span>; <span class="bibl">Apollod. 1.8.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 4.37</span>), and he had strong ties to
 Corinth and Boeotia. His only mythological connection with Attica is attested in his appearance on vase imagery, particularly among
 the boys sent to the Minotaur (see the Francois Vase [<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vaseindex?lookup=Florence+4209">Florence
 4209</a>]).</p>
 <p>Worship: Antiochos, son of Herakles, was worshipped appropriately at the Herakleion in Kynosarges (published by
 <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">C. Karouzos in <span class="titlem">ArchDelt</span> 8 [1923] 82-102</span>);
 some <span class="date">fourth century</span> tribal decrees found there refer
 to a priest of Antiochos); it is highly likely, however, that
 Antiochos’ cult came to Kynosarges after the <span class="term">Cleisthenic</span> reforms
 of <span class="date">508/7</span>, and his cult is not mentioned in Pausanias’ discussion of the Herakleion there (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.19.3</span>).</p>
 <p>Tribal connection: A member of the Antiochis
 tribe held the priesthood of Antiochos at Kynosarges, according to an inscription dated <span class="date">169/8</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/sourceindex?lookup=Dow+1937">Dow 1937,

 <p>Mythology: <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1992.04.0187">
 
 </a>Erechtheus, who is often confused (in ancient as in
 modern discussions) with Erichthonios, was born from the Earth
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hom. <span class="titlem">Il.</span>
 2.546-51</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 8.55</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Soph. <span class="titlem">Aj.</span> 202</span> [Erichthonios]). His mother is sometimes reported to have been Nemesis at Rhamnous, where he
 was king, and where he founded her temple (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Suda <span class="titlem">s.v.</span>
 ‘Ramnousia Nemesis’ (<span class="term">rho</span>,33)</span>). The Parian Marble (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">Marm. Par.</span> 28 ff.</span>)
 records that he was the son of Pandion and Zeuxippe, and twin brother of Boutes, who became
 priest when Erechtheus became King of Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Apollod.
 3.14.8</span>). His marriage to Praxithea is recorded in
 <span class="bibl">Eur. <span class="titlem">Erech.</span></span> His sons Kekrops II, Pandoros, and Metion, are mentioned by <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Apollod. 3.15.1</span>, and he had many daughters—Kreousa, Prokris (by whom he fathered Aglauros, according to <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hyg. <span class="titlem">Fab.</span> 253</span>), Chthonia, Oreithyia, and Hyakinthides. When he fought against Eleusis (<span class="bibl">Eur. <span class="titlem">Erech.</span></span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 2.15.1</span>) he gained victory by
 voluntarily sacrificing his daughters. His killing of Eumolpos
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Apollod. 3.15.4</span>) was avenged by
 Poseidon’s trident (<span class="bibl">Eur. <span class="titlem">Erech.</span> fr. 65.90</span>, <span class="bibl">92</span>?;
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Eur. <span class="titlem">Ion</span>

 <span class="titlem">Hesperia</span> 10 [1941] 113</span>).</p>
 <p>Worship: Erechtheus was worshipped at the Erechtheion, which is thought to have been part of the Temple of Athena Polias (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.26.5</span>) or perhaps within the
 building known now as the Erechtheion (see <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">K. Jeppesen, <span class="titlem">The Theory of the Alternative Erechtheion</span> [Aarhus 1987]</span>). Many sources
 confirm that he was worshipped on the Acropolis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 8.55</span>;
 <span class="bibl">Eur. <span class="titlem">Erech.</span> fr. 65.90-4
 Austin</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I2, 580</span>) and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hom. <span class="titlem">Il.</span> 2.546-51</span>
 attests that he was worshipped in the chief temple of Athena.
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 5.82</span> mentions also that he
 was worshipped in close connection with Athena Polias, perhaps at
 the Panathenaia).</p>
 <p>Erechtheus received worshipped also at Marathon (according to <span class="bibl">Nonnus

 <p>Erechtheus may have shared worship with Poseidon (according to <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus.

 Poseidon Erechtheus in <span class="bibl">Eur.

 noted by <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Apollod. 3.14.1</span>,
 encouraged Athenian pride in their sense of belonging to Attica. He was an early King of Attica,
 either the first (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">Marm. Par.</span> A 1</span>) or successor to Aktaios (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus.
 1.2.6</span>). With Agraulos, daughter of Aktaios, he had three daughters, Aglauros, Pandrosos and Herse (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Eur. Ion 270-272</span>; <span class="bibl">Philochorus
 <span class="titlem">FGrH</span> 328 F 106</span>) and a son, Erysichthon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Apollod.
 3.14.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.2.6</span>).
 Kekrops is said to have introduced several cults, including
 the cult of Kronos and Rhea to Attica (<span class="bibl">Philochorus <span class="titlem">FGrH</span> 328 F 97</span>),
 as well as non-animal sacrifice to Zeus Hypatos (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 8.2.3</span>). He is also credited with
 introducing customs (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph.
 <span class="titlem">Pl.</span> 773</span>) and writing (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Tac. <span class="titlem">Ann.</span> 11.14</span>), and
 even presided over the contest between Athena and Poseidon for the patronage of Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 35.10</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Apollod. 3.14.1</span> suggests
 otherwise).</p>
 <p>Worship: Kekrops was worshipped on the Acropolis (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2,
 1156</span>), perhaps in a cave (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Eur.
 <span class="titlem">Ion</span> 1400</span>), a tomb (<span class="bibl">Clem. Alex.
 <span class="titlem">Protr.</span> 3.45</span>), or a corner near the south wall of the Erechtheion (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span>
 I3, 474.59-63</span>); here his priesthood was hereditary among the
 Amynandridai (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2,
 2388</span>). By the time of Hadrian times Kekrops was also worshipped in the Thriasian Plain. Kekrops may also
 have received worship outside Attica: in Haliartos (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 9.33.1</span>) and in Megara (<span class="bibl">Hsych.

 <p>Mythology: Although another Attic hero (Leos the herald; see
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span> 13</span>) is
 known by this name, Leos the eponymous hero has no mythology

 <p>Worship: Leos was worshipped in the deme Skambonidai (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3,

 the Leokoreion (discussed by <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">S. Rotroff, <span class="titlem">Hesperia</span> 47 [1978] 206-207</span>).</p>
 <p>Tribal connection: The priest of Leos was chosen from among

Pandion may have been worshipped at Plotheia, where games in his honor (?), the Pandia, were celebrated (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span>
 I3, 258.9</span>); he probably also received a sacrifice as founder
 of the Pandia (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/sourceindex?lookup=Kearns+1989">Kearns
 1989, 81</a>). Pandion received worship outside Attica, at his tomb in the cave Sanctuary of Athena Aithyia in Megara. He also received a
 monument in Megara (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.5.3</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1.39.4</span>, and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.41.6</span>).</p>

 heroes). The entire base was surrounded by a barrier of fence posts (some marble and
