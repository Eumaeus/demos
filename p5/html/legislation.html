<div class="Summary" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Summary</span></h2>

<p>Athenians in the <span class="date">4th century</span> were governed by laws (<span class="foreign">νόμοι</span>, or <span class="foreign">νόμος</span> in the singular) and decrees (<span class="foreign">ψήφισματα</span>, or <span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span> in the singular). Decrees were passed by a vote of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, of the <span class="term">Council</span>, or both. Laws came into being by a more complicated process. Laws took precedence over Decrees. Anyone who proposed a decree in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> that contradicted an existing law was subject to prosecution on a charge of <span class="term">‘Illegal Proposal’</span> (<span class="foreign">γραφὴ παρανόμων</span>). Laws were passed through a process called <span class="titlem">nomothesia</span> (<span class="foreign">νομοθεσία</span>) or ‘legislation.’ Each year the <span class="term">Assembly</span> met to discuss the current body of laws. Any citizen could propose a change in the laws, but could only propose the repeal of a law if he suggested another law to replace the repealed law. If the <span class="term">Assembly</span> decided to change the laws, a board of <span class="term">Nomothetai</span> (<span class="foreign">νομοθέται</span>) or ‘legislators’ was selected to review and revise the laws. The process of legislation was like a trial, with advocates speaking in defense of the existing laws, and others speaking against the existing laws. The Nomothetai would vote on changes, and any changes that passed were published on inscriptions near the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span> and read aloud at the next meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The Nomothetai also undertook an annual review of all existing laws, to make sure that none contradicted others, and that none were redundant.</p>

<div class="Section" id="Terms"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Terms</span></h2>


<div class="p">To understand legislation under the Athenian democracy, it is necessary to understand some terms. The Athenians of the <span class="date">5th century BCE</span> seem to have used two words interchangeably to refer to what we call a ‘law,’ <span class="term">nomos</span> (<span class="foreign">νόμος</span>) and <span class="term">psephisma</span> (<span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span>). In the <span class="date">4th century</span> these words had two distinct meanings: a <span class="term">nomos</span> was a ‘law,’ while a <span class="term">psephisma</span> was a ‘decree.’ For the <span class="date">5th century</span> usage, we have the historian Xenophon and his his account of a speech that Euryptolemus gave before the <span class="term">Assembly</span> in <span class="date">406</span> (Source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OHCW</span></span>). The speaker tells his audience that, in a particular case, either the <span class="term">psephisma</span> of Kannonus applies (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.20</span>), or the <span class="term">psephisma</span> regarding temple-robbers and traitors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.21</span>); he then refers to both of these <span class="term">psephismata</span> as <span class="quote_inline"><span class="term">nomoi</span></span> (the plural form of <span class="term">nomos</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.22</span>). So it would seem that these two terms were more-or-less equivalent. In the <span class="date">4th century</span>, however, these two terms clearly refered to two different things: <span class="term">nomoi</span> were laws enacted through a special process of legislation, while <span class="term">psephismata</span> were decrees passed by a vote of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The orator Aeschines in one of his speeches asks, rhetorically, why the ‘laws’ (<span class="foreign">νόμοι</span>) are good, but the ‘decrees’ of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">ψήφισματα</span>) are bad (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.177</span>). The philosopher Aristotle makes a theoretical distinction between ‘laws’ and ‘decrees,’ noting that in certain kinds of democracy the laws rule, but in other kinds of democracies decrees can override laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1292a</span>). Athens was the former kind of democracy, according to Demosthenes, who quotes a principle of Athenian governance, that <span class="quote_inline">No decree, either of the <span class="term">Council</span> or the <span class="term">Assembly</span> shall have more authority than a law</span> (<span class="foreign">ψήφισμα δὲ μηδὲν μήτε βουλῆς μήτε δήμου νόμου κυριώτερον εἶναι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.87</span>).</div>

<div class="p">On the other hand, the laws could determine what sorts of decrees the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could pass, such as a law that allows the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to pass a decree honoring a citizen, but that limits the circumstances of such an honor (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.36</span>). The <span class="term">courts</span> could nullify a decree, based on the laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.96</span>). When inscribed on stone for the permanent record, decrees begin with the formula, <span class="quote_inline">it was decided by the <span class="term">People</span>,</span> or, <span class="quote_inline">It was decided by the <span class="term">Council</span> and the <span class="term">People</span></span> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 206 4-5</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 206 28-30</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 237.5</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 237 31</span>); a law began with the formula, <span class="quote_inline">It was decided by the Nomothetae</span> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">SEG</span> 12 87.607</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The Athenians had no formal consitution such as the United States has, a body of laws that fundamentally define the state. Some laws, however, included additional clauses that made it very difficult to change or revoke the law. One such clause is quoted at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.62</span>: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Whosoever, whether magistrate or private citizen, shall cause this ordinance to be frustrated, or shall alter the same, shall be disfranchised with his children and his property</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.62</span>; see also <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 43.51-63 = Tod 123</span>).</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="WrittenvUnwritten"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Written vs. Unwritten Laws</span></h2>


<div class="p">A law included as a quotation in a speech by the orator Andocides says, <blockquote class="quote"><p>In no circumstances shall magistrates enforce a law which has not been inscribed. No decree, whether of the <span class="term">Council</span> or <span class="term">Assembly</span>, shall override a law. No law shall be directed against an individual without applying to all citizens alike, unless an <span class="term">Assembly</span> of six thousand so resolve by secret ballot</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.87</span>). This establishes three important principles of Athenian legislation: (in order from last to first) that except under very special circumstances, the laws of Athens were to apply to all citizens equally; that the laws (<span class="foreign">νόμοι</span>) had more authority than the decrees (<span class="foreign">πσήφισματα</span>) of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> or <span class="term">Council</span>; and finally that only the written laws were valid.</div>

<div class="p">According to Plutarch, when Solon revised the laws of Athens in the <span class="date">6th century BCE</span>, he wrote the new laws on wooden tablets (<span class="foreign">εἰς ξυλίνους ἄξονας</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 25.1</span>). By inscribing laws, either on wood or in stone, and setting them in a public place, knowledge of the laws was made available to all citizens rather than to a small elite. As Demosthenes says, <span class="quote_inline">all the citizens have the same laws before them, simple to read and to understand</span> (<span class="foreign">πᾶσιν ᾖ ταὔτ᾽ ἀναγνῶναι καὶ μαθεῖν ἁπλᾶ καὶ σαφῆ τὰ δίκαια</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.93</span>).</div> 

<div class="p">Knowledge of the laws was important, since juries in the <span class="term">Peoples’ Court</span> were made up from the citizens in general. Demosthenes reminds the jurors sitting in judgement on one occasion, <span class="quote_inline">You have sworn to give a verdict according to the laws, and to the decrees of the <span class="term">People</span> and of the <span class="term">Council of Five Hundred</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.179</span>; note that he mentions the laws before the decrees).</div>

<div class="p">But elsewhere, Demosthenes reminds Athenian jurors that the laws cannot cover every eventuality: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Again, men of Athens, you must also consider well and carefully the fact that you have come into court today, sworn to give your verdict according to the laws… and where there are no statutes to guide you, you are sworn to decide according to the best of your judgement</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.118</span>). So in the absence of clear laws, jurors were free to vote according to unwritten laws, or their own understanding of justice (or their own prejudices).</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="History"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">A History of Legislation in Athens in the <span class="date">late 5th and early 4th centuries BCE</span></span></h2>


<p>In <span class="date">411</span> BCE, a group of Athenians overturned the democracy and installed an oligarchic government; during this crisis, both the oligarchs and the democrats claimed to be supporting the ‘ancestral constitution’ (<span class="foreign">τοὺς πατρίους νόμους</span>), the laws established in the <span class="date">6th century</span> by Solon, and after him, those by Cleisthenes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 29.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.97.6</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, <span class="titlem">Athenian Democracy</span>, 162</span>). The next year, <span class="date">410</span> BCE, when the oligarchy was overthrown, the restored democratic government immediately set up a body of ‘Law Publishers’ (<span class="foreign">ἀναγραφεῖς τῶν νόμων</span>) to publish all of the laws, especially those of Draco and Solon (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 104.5-6</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.25</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, <span class="titlem">Athenian Democracy</span>, 162-163</span>). That this was one of the first actions of the newly restored democracy suggests the importance Athenians placed on public knowledge of the laws. Nicomachus was in charge of this board, as ‘Commissioner of Laws’ (<span class="foreign">τῶν νόμων ἀναγραφεὺς</span>), and was originally supposed to complete publication in four months (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.2</span>). The board spent six years, however, compiling and publishing Solon’s body of laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.2-3</span>). The published laws, which included the homicide law of Draco and laws regarding the powers of the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="bibl">M&amp;L 86</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 105</span>) were inscribed on the wall of the Stoa Basileios in the Agora (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.2-3</span>).</p>

<p>In <span class="date">404</span> BCE, when Athens surrended to Sparta, the government of the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>, imposed on Athens by the Spartans, removed these published laws from the Stoa Basileios (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.2-3</span>). Nicomachus, the head of the ‘Law Publishers’ was later put on trial, accused of manipulating the laws he published and helping the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span> consolidate their power (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.1-3</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Like the Oligarchy of <span class="date">411</span>, the tyranny of the <span class="term">Thirty</span> lasted only one year, and after it was overthrown and the city returned to democratic rule, Athens once again compiled and codified its old laws: <blockquote class="quote"><p>On the motion of Teisamenos the <span class="term">People</span> decreed that Athens be governed as of old, in accordance with the laws of Solon, his weights and his measures, and in accordance with the statutes of Draco, which we used in times past. Such further laws as may be necessary shall be inscribed upon tables by the Nomothetae elected by the <span class="term">Council</span> and named hereafter, exposed before the <span class="term">Tribal Statues</span> for all to see, and handed over to the <span class="term">magistrates</span> during the present month. The laws thus handed over, however, shall be submitted beforehand to the scrutiny of the <span class="term">Council</span> and the five hundred Nomothetae elected by the Demes, when they have taken their oath. Further, any private citizen who so desires may come before the <span class="term">Council</span> and suggest improvements in the laws. When the laws have been ratified, they shall be placed under the guardianship of the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>, to the end that only such laws as have been ratified may be applied by magistrates. Those laws which are approved shall be inscribed upon the wall, where they were inscribed aforetime, for all to see</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.83-84</span>).</div>

<div class="p">To affirm a principle of democratic rule, Teisamenos’ decree was followed by another law that said, <span class="quote_inline">In no circumstance shall magistrates enforce a law which has not been inscribed <span class="note" id="Note1"> [that is, written down and published in a public place]</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.85</span>).</div>

<p>After inscribing the old laws of Solon and Draco, which Andocides says were to be used temporarily while the democracy codified new laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.81</span>), the Athenians appointed a board of ‘law givers’ or <span class="term">nomothetae</span> (<span class="foreign">νομοθέται</span>) to conduct a ‘scrutiny’ (<span class="foreign">δοκιμασία</span>) of all the laws, in other words, to examine the laws and vote on whether each law should remain in effect (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.84</span>). According to Andocides, this revision of the laws happened quickly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.85</span>). The nomothetae dealt with the laws of Draco and Solon, and to other laws as well (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.96-98</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.42</span>), including a codification of all the sacrifices that Athens had to carry out during the course of a year (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.17</span>).</p>

<p>Even after this revision, Athenians continued to refer to the ‘laws of Draco and Solon’ (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.51</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.42</span>). It does seem that in the <span class="date">4th century</span> homicide was still governed by Draco’s homicide law (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.37</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 43.57</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 104</span>), and the laws of inheritance were closely based on Solon’s laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 44.67-68</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 46.14</span>).</p>

<p>After Andocides, there is no <span class="date">4th century</span> reference to laws being published at the Stoa Basileios; orators mention laws published on pillars (<span class="foreign">στῆλαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.75-76</span>) or in the Metroon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 25.99</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lyc. 1.66</span>). Mogens Hansen suggests that in the <span class="date">4th century</span> there were simply too many laws to put them all on stone, so they were written on papyrus and kept in the public archives at the Metroon (<span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, <span class="titlem">Athenian Democracy</span>, 164-165</span>).</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Nomothetae"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">The Process of Making Laws: the Nomothetae</span></h2>


<p>The procedures for making new laws or revising existing laws was complicated, and seems to have been intended to make the process as democratic as possible, and to prevent any hasty or poorly considered changes to the laws.</p>

<div class="p">When the Athenian democracy published a law (<span class="foreign">νόμος</span>), as opposed to a decree (<span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span>), the text of the law began with the formula: <span class="quote_inline">It was decided by the nomothetae</span> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">SEG</span> 12 87.6-7</span>; decrees began with the formula, <span class="quote_inline">It was decided by the <span class="term">People</span>,</span> or, <span class="quote_inline">It was decided by the <span class="term">Council</span> and the <span class="term">People</span>,</span> <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 206 4-5</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 206 28-30</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 237.5</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 237 31</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Demosthenes describes process of legislation in detail, in his speech prosecuting Timocrates (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24</span>). He reminds the jurors that, <blockquote class="quote"><p>In our laws at present in force, men of Athens, every condition that must be observed when new statutes are to be enacted is laid down clearly and with precision. First of all, there is a prescribed time for legislation; but even at the proper time a man is not permitted to propose his law just as he pleases. He is directed, in the first place, to put it in writing and post it in front of the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span> for everyone to see. Then it is ordained that the law must be of universal application, and also that laws of contrary purpose must be repealed; and there are other directions with which I do not think I need trouble you now</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.17-18</span>).</div>

<p>While any citizen could suggest changes to the laws, laws were not passed by the <span class="term">Assembly</span> or the <span class="term">Council</span>, as decrees were, but were passed by a rather prolonged process involving the ‘Law givers,’ the nomothetae (<span class="foreign">νομοθέται</span>; the singular form is <span class="foreign">νομοθετής</span>). Panels of Nomothetae were formed for the purposes of creating new laws and reviewing existing laws; the Nomothetae were drawn from Athenians who had sworn the ‘dikastic oath,’ the oath that jurors swore before entering a courtroom (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>; a passage in Demosthenes, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.149-151</span>, purports to be the text of that oath). So these Nomothetae were ordinary citizens assigned the task of creating and revising the laws.</p>

<p>These Nomothetae would get together and conduct legislation under three circumstances: if the <span class="term">Assembly</span> called for revisions to the laws, if an individual Athenian proposed a change in the laws, and if the six <span class="term">Archons</span> called the Thesmothetae (<span class="foreign">θεσμοθέται</span>; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.1</span>) undertook a scrutiny of the laws (respectively: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.38</span>).</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Assembly"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">Legislation Initiated by the <span class="term">Assembly</span></span></h2>


<p>At the first meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> for the year, in the month of <span class="term">Hekatombaion</span>, the Athenians held votes on the whole body of laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span> where the month of <span class="term">Hekatombaion</span> is specified). This is how Demosthenes describes the process:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>In the first presidency and on the eleventh day thereof, in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, the Herald having read prayers, a vote shall be taken on the laws, to wit, first upon laws respecting the <span class="term">Council</span>, and secondly upon general statutes, and then upon statutes enacted for the nine <span class="term">Archons</span>, and then upon laws affecting other authorities. Those who are content with the laws respecting the <span class="term">Council</span> shall hold up their hands first, and then those who are not content; and in like manner in respect of general statutes. All voting upon laws shall be in accordance with laws already in force</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>).</div>

<p>This passage tells us several things. First, it suggests that the laws of Athens were divided into several categories. There were laws concerning the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="foreign">περὶ τῶν βουλευτικῶν</span>); this presumably included laws governing the Nomothetae and the procedure for legislation itself, since it was the <span class="term">Council</span> that appointed the panels of Nomothetae (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.47-48</span>). There were laws ‘common’ to all Athenians (<span class="foreign">τῶν κοινῶν</span>). There were laws having to do with the nine <span class="term">Archons</span> (<span class="foreign">οἳ κεῖνται τοῖς ἐννέα ἄρχουσιν</span>). And there were laws having to do with ‘other authorities’ (<span class="foreign">τῶν ἄλλων ἀρχῶν</span>). This passage also tells us that the <span class="term">Assembly</span> voted on the existing laws by a show of hands (<span class="foreign">χειροτονία</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Demosthenes continues his description of the annual review: <blockquote class="quote"><p>If any law already in force be rejected on show of hands, the presidents <span class="note" id="Note2"> [<span class="foreign">τοὺς πρυτάνεις</span>, the ‘Prytaneis’ described in the article on the <span class="term">Council</span>]</span> in whose term of office the voting takes place shall appoint the last of the three meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> for the consideration of laws so rejected. The commissioners <span class="note" id="Note3"> [<span class="foreign">τοὺς προέδρους</span>, the ‘Proedroi’]</span> who preside by lot at the <span class="term">Assembly</span> are required, immediately after religious observances, to put the question respecting the sessions of the Nomothetae (<span class="foreign">τῶν νομοθετῶν</span>), and respecting the fund from which their fees are to be paid. The Nomothetae (<span class="foreign">τοὺς δὲ νομοθέτας</span>) shall consist of persons who have taken the judicial oath</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>).</div>

<p>So, if the <span class="term">Assembly</span> voted against any of the current laws, several things happened. First, the Prytaneis (those in charge of the <span class="term">Council</span> for that month, who set the agendas for meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>) would set aside the last meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> in that month for discussion of the laws. The Nomothetae, ordinary citizens selected out of those who had sworn the oath that all jurors swore, would conduct the actual process of legislation, but the <span class="term">Assembly</span> would decide certain details regarding the meetings of the Nomothetae. Specifically, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> would discuss payment for the Nomothetae (mentioned here at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>), and how much the Nomothetae should be given to conduct their business (this is mentioned more specifically at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.23</span>).</p>

<div class="p">The Athenians took this process very seriously, as Demosthenes tells us, and specified severe penalties for any official who deviated from the proper procedure: <blockquote class="quote"><p>If the Prytaneis do not convene the <span class="term">Assembly</span> according to the written regulations, or if the Proedroi do not put the question, each president shall forfeit one thousand drachmas of sacred money to Athene, and each commissioner shall forfeit forty drachmas of sacred money to Athene, and information thereof shall be laid before the Thesmothetae in such manner as when a man holds office being in debt to the treasury; and the <span class="term">Thesmothetae</span> shall bring before the <span class="term">Court</span> according to the law all persons against whom such information is laid; otherwise they shall not be raised to the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>, as obstructing the rectification of the statutes</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.22</span>).</div>

<p>So the punishment for failing to follow the proper procedure was a 1000 drachma fine, and in the case of one of the archons, disqualification from serving on the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> after his term in office.</p>

<div class="p">Before this meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, when the Athenians voted on the existing laws, anyone who wanted to change the laws was supposed to make public specific proposals for new laws: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Before the meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> any Athenian citizen who wishes shall write down the laws proposed by him and exhibit the same in front of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span>, to the end that the <span class="term">People</span> may vote on the question of the time allowed to the Nomothetae with due regard to the total number of laws proposed. Whosoever proposes a new statute shall write it on a white board and exhibit it in front of the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span> on every day until the meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span>).</div>

<p>This must have meant that the vote on the existing laws was equivalent to a vote on the proposed changes. If the citizens liked the suggestions posted beforehand, they could vote against the existing laws, thus starting a process of legislation. If the citizens did not like the posted suggestions, they would vote in favor of the existing laws. Requiring proposed changes before the meeting would allow the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to make an informed decision regarding how long the Nomothetae should take to conduct their business (see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.94</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.36</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.39</span>).</p>

<p>Demosthenes says, elsewhere in his speech against Timocrates, that it was lawful for any citizen to propose changing an existing law, but only if he suggested a new law to take its place (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>).</p>

<div class="p">The <span class="term">Assembly</span>, at this first meeting of the year (on the 11th day of the month <span class="term">Hekatombaion</span>), would also choose five citizens to <span class="quote_inline">speak in defence of laws proposed for repeal before the Nomothetae</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span>). This suggests that the process of legislation was very much like a trial in a courtroom, with some people ‘prosecuting’ the existing laws (and advocating new laws), and others defending the existing laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.36</span>).</div>

<p>After this first meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> for the year, if the voting determined that the laws should be reviewed and possibly changed, there was a delay, presumably to let people consider matters. No further action happened at the next meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> in that month, but at the third meeting, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> decided how long the Nomothetae should spend legislating, and details of their pay (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.24</span>).</p>

<p>The Nomothetae were not chosen until the actual day assigned for legislation; on the morning of that day they were chosen by lot from those who had sworn the Heliastic Oath that all <span class="term">jurors</span> swore (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>). A board of nomothetae could be huge: Demosthenes reports that in <span class="date">354/3 BCE</span>, Timocrates passed in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> a decree setting up a board of 1001 Nomothetae, and ordering the <span class="term">Council</span> to assist them in their work (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>; source for date, <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, <span class="titlem">Athenian Democracy</span>, 167</span>). It should be mentioned, however, that Demosthenes attacked this particular motion by Timocrates as being illegal, although not, it seems, for the number of Nomothetae that Timocrates proposed (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24</span>).</p>

<p>The meeting of the Nomothetae was conducted by Proedroi (<span class="foreign">τοὺς προέδρους</span> mentioned at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>). One of these served as chairman (<span class="foreign">ἐπιστάτης τῶν προέδρων</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 222.41-52</span>). The meeting was conducted like a trial, with advocates speaking in favor of the existing laws (<span class="foreign">τοὺς συναπολογησομένους τὸν δῆμον τοῖς νόμοις</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span>), and others speaking in favor of changing the laws (<span class="foreign">τοὺς συνηγόρους</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.36</span>). When both parties had spoken, the Nomothetae voted by show of hands (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>).</p>

<p>Any new laws proposed by the Nomothetae were published near the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span> and were also read aloud to the next meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.94</span>).</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="OtherWays"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">Other Ways of Initiating Legislation</span></h2>


<p>In addition to this regularly scheduled, annual, opportunity for legislation, there were other ways of initiation the process of making changes to the laws of Athens. Any citizen could, at any time, propose a change in the laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>). The <span class="term">Archons</span>, specifically the <span class="term">Thesmothetae</span>, were also charged with making an annual review of the existing laws and, if they found contradictory laws or redundant laws, they could arrange for a board of Nomothetae to change the laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.38</span>).</p>

<p>In the case of an individual citizen who wanted to change the laws, he could not propose repealing a law without suggesting a new law to take its place (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.89-94</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>). The <span class="term">Assembly</span> would decide whether or not the proposal had sufficient merit to be brought before the Nomothetae (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 3.10-13</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.39</span>).</p>

<div class="p">The <span class="term">Council</span> had to be involved, too, because it was the <span class="term">Council</span> that set the agenda for meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. So once a citizen had posted a proposal for new legislation, the <span class="term">Council</span> had to put the issue on the agenda for a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>; this was done by means of a <span class="term">probouleuma</span> (<span class="foreign">προβούλευμα</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.48</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.39</span>). <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span> contains a decree that orders <span class="quote_inline">the <span class="term">Council</span> to cooperate in the legislative process</span> (<span class="foreign">συννομοθετεῖν δὲ καὶ τὴν βουλήν</span>) in the matter of convening the Nomothetae, which may mean only that the <span class="term">Council</span> was to ensure that the business appeared on the agenda for the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The <span class="term">Council</span> did, however, also have a special ‘legislative secretary’ (<span class="foreign">γραμματεύς ἐπὶ τοὺς νόμους</span>), who made copies of all laws, and attended all meetings of the <span class="term">Council</span>; this suggests that the <span class="term">Council</span> discussed proposals for legislation before sending them on to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 54.4</span>; <span class="bibl">Agora XV 62.235-236</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The Thesmothetae were required to review all the laws of Athens every year. (There were nine <span class="term">Archons</span>: the Archon, the King Archon, the Polemarch, and six Thesmothetae; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.1</span>). Aeschines says: <blockquote class="quote"><p>[The lawgiver] has expressly laid upon the Thesmothetae the duty of making an annual revision of the laws in the presence of the people, prescribing sharp investigation and examination, in order to determine whether any law stands written which contradicts another law, or an invalid law stands among the valid, or whether more laws than one stand written to govern each action. And if they find such a thing, they are required to write it out and post it on bulletins in front of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span>; and the Prytaneis are required to call a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, writing at the head of the call, <span class="quote_inline">For Nomothetae</span>; and the chairman of the Proedroi must submit to vote the question of the removal of one set of laws and the retention of the other, in order that for each action there may be one law and no more</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.38-39</span>).</div>

<p>Demosthenes also suggests that it would be possible for the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to convene the Nomothetae for the sole purpose of repealing laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 3.12</span>). It was unlawful for an individual Athenian to suggest the repeal of a law without offering a replacement, but perhaps the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was not limited in that way (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.89-94</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>).</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Scrutiny"><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">Scrutiny of Laws</span></h2>


<p>Since laws, passed by the Nomothetae, were more important than decrees of the <span class="term">Council</span> or <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.87</span>), what happened when a decree contradicted a law? Or, what happened when someone proposed a law in a way that violated the laws governing legislation?</p>

<p>A <span class="term">graphe paranomon</span> (<span class="foreign">παρανόμων γραφή</span>, or <span class="foreign">γραφὴ παρανόμων</span>), or ‘prosecution for having proposed an unlawful decree,’ was the means by which the Athenians ensured the sovreignty of the laws; any such charge would be tried before the <span class="term">People’s Court</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 59.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>).</p>

<p>Demosthenes’ speech against Timocrates focuses on just such a charge; the prosecution claims that Timocrates introduced a new law that contradicted an old law (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>). That doing so was illegal runs contrary to the assumption in American law that newer legislation takes precedence over older laws.</p>

<p>Demosthenes actually claims that Timocrates’ proposal was illegal for several reasons. First, it contradicted already existing laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>). Second, the proposal had not been published by the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.18</span>). Third, he did not allow the <span class="term">Council</span> to consider the law before referring it to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.26</span>). Finally, he did not follow the lawful schedule, which would have meant proposing a new law at one meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, taking no action at the next meeting, and at the third meeting voting on whether or not to convene the Nomothetae (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>); Timocrates, it is alleged, proposed his law at one meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> and moved that it be handed over to the Nomothetae on the very next day (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.28</span>).</p>

<p>Demosthenes’ speech against Leptines (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20</span>) is another example of a <span class="term">graphe paranomon</span>. Here, Demosthenes claims that Leptines arranged for the Nomothetae to pass a law without repealing any contrary laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.89</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.96</span>), publishing the proposal beforehand, or allowing the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to consider the matter before sending it to the Nomothetae (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.93</span>).</p>

<p>Demosthenes himself was once charged with improperly suggesting the emendation of a law governing the maintenance of warships (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.105</span>).</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Criticism"><h2><span class="headingNumber">9. </span><span class="head">Criticism of Athenian Legislation</span></h2>


<p>Aristotle criticises direct democracy on the grounds that in democracy decrees (<span class="foreign">ψήφισματα</span>) have more authority than laws (<span class="foreign">νόμοι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1297a4-1297a7</span>). But this criticism does not seem to apply to the democracy of <span class="date">4th century</span> Athens.</p>

<div class="p">We find a more apt criticism in Aristotle’s <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span></span>), which says that in Athens everything is decided by <span class="quote_inline">decrees and lawcourts</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.2</span>); since the legislators, the Nomothetae, were chosen from the same pool as potential jurors, and swore the same oaths as jurors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.149-151</span>), this comment seems fairly accurate. Whether or not we should see this fact as a bad thing is, of course, a matter of opinion.</div>

<p>We also find Athenians criticizing their city’s legislation. Both Isocrates and Demosthenes complain that Athens passes too many laws and fails to enforce them (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 8.50</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.142</span>). Demosthenes makes another criticism, accusing his fellow Athenians of legislating too frequently and in too much haste; he says that there are too many new laws that invalidate older decrees, but that those decrees are still in force—a confusing state of affairs (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.91-92</span>).</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Praise"><h2><span class="headingNumber">10. </span><span class="head">Praise for Athenian Legislation</span></h2>


<div class="p">The Athenians do seem to have been, on the whole, proud of the distinction between decrees and laws. Aeschines, for example, asks and answers a rhetorical question pitting the decrees of the Assembly, which were easy to pass, against the laws, which were subject to the complex procedures for legislation: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Why do you suppose it is, fellow citizens, that the existing laws are good, but that the decrees of the city are inferior to them, and that the verdicts rendered in the courts are sometimes open to censure? I will explain to you the reason. It is because you enact the laws with no other object than justice, not moved by unrighteous gain, or by either partiality or animosity, looking solely to what is just and for the common good. And because you are, as I think, naturally, more clever than other men, it is not surprising that you pass most excellent laws. But in the meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> and in the <span class="term">Courts</span>, you oftentimes lose all hold of the discussion of the matter in hand, and are led away by deceit and trickery</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.177-178</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Demosthenes praises this practice of legislating (<span class="foreign">τοὺς νόμους τιθέναι</span>) as being open and democratic (<span class="foreign">παρ᾽ ὑμῖν, ἐν τοῖς ὀμωμοκόσιν, παρ᾽ οἷσπερ καὶ τἄλλα κυροῦται</span>), and in helping the average citizen keep track of the laws of the city: <blockquote class="quote"><p>[The Nomothetae undertake their annual review] so that there may be only one law dealing with each subject, and that the plain citizen may not be puzzled by such contradictions and be at a disadvantage compared with those who are acquainted with the whole body of law, but that all may have the same ordinances before them, simple and clear to read and understand</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.93</span>).</div>

<div class="p">As for the laws themselves, the products of the complex and carefully designed process of <span class="foreign">νομοθεσία</span>, legislation, we find similar praise. The orator Lycurgus reminds his listeners that, <blockquote class="quote"><p>The things which in the main uphold our democracy and preserve the city’s prosperity are three in number: first the system of law, second the vote of the jury, and third the method of prosecution by which the crimes are handed over to them</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lyc. 1.3-4</span>).</div>

<div class="p">And Demosthenes tells a jury, <blockquote class="quote"><p>I shall say nothing novel or extravagant or peculiar, but only what you all know to be true as well as I do. For if any of you cares to inquire what is the motive-power that calls together the <span class="term">Council</span>, draws the people into the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, fills the <span class="term">law-courts</span>, makes the old <span class="term">archons</span> resign readily to the new, and enables the whole life of the State to be carried on and preserved, he will find that it is the laws and the obedience that all men yield to the laws; since, if once they were done away with and every man were given licence to do as he liked, not only does the constitution vanish, but our life would not differ from that of the beasts of the field</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 25.20</span>).</div>

<p>The procedures for enforcing the laws are a subject more appropriate to a discussion of the ‘<span class="term">People’s Court</span>’.</p>
