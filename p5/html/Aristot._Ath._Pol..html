<p>(Aristotle, <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span>; see also philosophy). According to Hesychius, Aristotle wrote <div class="cit"><div class="citbibl"></div><div class="citquote">descriptions of the constitutions of individual cities, democracies, oligarchies, aristocracies, and tyrannies, 158 of them.</div></div> (<span class="foreign">πολιτείας πόλεων ἰδιωτικῶν καὶ δημοκρατικῶν καὶ ὀλιγαρξικῶν καὶ ἀριστροκρατικῶν καὶ τυραννικῶν ρνη</span>) (Source, <span class="bibl">V. Rose, Teubner ed. of Aristotle's fragments, p. 16</span>). Of these, only this one, the <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span>, survives today. It comes to us in two major papyrus fragments, the first (P. Berol. 163) was acquired in <span class="date">1859</span>, and the second (P. Lond. 131) in <span class="date">1888</span>. Both papyri date from the <span class="date">2nd century CE</span>, although the text they contain was more than four hundred years older. The work itself is a short history of government at Athens, followed by a description of how the Athenian democracy operated at the time that the text was originally written. The <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span>, or <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span></span>, seems to have been written after <span class="date">334 BCE</span> and before <span class="date">322 BCE</span>. Scholars do not agree on whether its author was Aristotle himself, or a member of Aristotle's school at Athens, but as P.J. Rhodes points out, this question is more important to students of Aristotle than it is to students of Athenian history.(Source, <span class="bibl">P.J. Rhodes, <span class="titlem">A Commentary on the Aristotelian Athenaion Politeia</span> [Oxford, 1981], especially pp. 1-5, 51-53, 58-63</span>). For the sake of convenience, we will refer to Aristotle as the author of the <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span>.</p>
