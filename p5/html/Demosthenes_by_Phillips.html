 </a>Demosthenes son of Demosthenes of the deme Paeania (<span class="date">384-322</span>) is generally regarded as the greatest of the Attic orators.
 At the age of seven he lost his father and was entrusted, along with his inheritance, to
 guardians. When he turned eighteen, however, he discovered that most of the money was
 gone; and so, after studying under Isaeus, Demosthenes took his guardians to court in <span class="date">364</span>. He delivered his first speeches (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">27</span>-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">31</span>) in these cases, and their success launched his career as a speechwriter.</p>
 <p>Demosthenes’ long and illustrious political
 career began in <span class="date">355</span>, when he composed speeches for the trials of
 Androtion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">22</span>) and Leptines (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">20</span>). In the latter half of the <span class="date">350s</span> he continued to write forensic speeches for
 high-profile cases (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">24 ‘Against
 Timocrates’</span>, <span class="date">353</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">23 ‘Against Aristocrates’</span>,
 <span class="date">352</span>), and also delivered his first speeches before the
 Athenian <span class="term">Assembly</span>, including <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Symmories’ (14)</span> in
 <span class="date">354</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘For
 the Megalopolitans’ (13)</span> in <span class="date">353</span>, and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Liberty of the Rhodians’
 (15)</span> in <span class="date">351</span>.</p>
 <p>Demosthenes rose to prominence as the foremost Athenian
 opponent of Philip II. In <span class="date">351</span> he
 delivered his <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘First
 Philippic’ (4)</span>, in which he called for a more aggressive stance
 toward the rising threat of Macedon. In the three
 ‘Olynthiacs’ (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1</span>-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">3</span>) of <span class="date">348</span> he urged his countrymen to send aid to Olynthus, which was under Macedonian attack; but the auxiliary expeditions
 sent by Athens could not prevent Philip’s capture of the city. In <span class="date">346</span>
 Demosthenes took part in the embassies to Philip regarding the ‘Peace of Philocrates;’ on his return from the second embassy he accused
 several fellow ambassadors, including Aeschines, of
 taking bribes from Philip, and he attacked Philip for negotiating in bad faith. Despite his dissatisfaction, later in the
 year he delivered the speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the
 Peace’ (5)</span>, counseling the Athenians to abide by its terms.</p>
 <p>For the remainder of the decade Demosthenes continued
 to agitate against Philip at home and abroad, delivering the
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Second Philippic’
 (6)</span> in <span class="date">344</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Chersonese’ (8)</span>
 and the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Third Philippic’
 (9)</span> in <span class="date">341</span>. In <span class="date">343</span>
 Demosthenes brought Aeschines to trial and gave the oration <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the False Embassy’
 (19)</span>; Aeschines escaped a death sentence by a
 mere thirty votes. Demosthenes’ policy of
 resistance to Philip triumphed, but the resistance itself
 failed at the battle of Chaeroneia in <span class="date">338</span>. Nonetheless, Demosthenes
 remained influential at Athens. In <span class="date">336</span>
 Ctesiphon proposed that Demosthenes be awarded a gold crown for his public services; Aeschines brought an indictment against Ctesiphon for making an <span class="term">illegal
 proposal</span>, but the case did not go to trial until <span class="date">330</span>.
 At Ctesiphon’s trial Demosthenes delivered his most famous oration, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Crown’ (18)</span>, and
 Aeschines was soundly defeated.</p>
 <p>Philip’s assassination in <span class="date">336</span> led to an abortive attempt at revolt in which Demosthenes played a prominent role. For a while afterwards the Athenians
 acclimated themselves to Macedonian hegemony. In <span class="date">324-323</span>, however, Demosthenes was implicated
 in a scandal involving Harpalus, the fugitive treasurer of
 Alexander the Great. Accused of appropriating twenty talents
 of the funds Harpalus had brought to Athens, Demosthenes was convicted, fined,
 and imprisoned for failure to pay, but escaped and went into exile. Upon Alexander’s death in <span class="date">323</span> he
 returned to Athens and again advised resistance to
 Macedon. After Antipater’s defeat of the Greek rebels in the ‘Lamian War,’
 Demosthenes, facing a death sentence, committed suicide
 by poison. (See also Oratory.)</p>
