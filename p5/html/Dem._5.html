<p> (Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">On the Peace</span>, see also Oratory). This is a speech that Demosthenes composed for delivery at a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The subject of the speech is a treaty of peace between Athens and Philip of Macedon, which was established in <span class="date">346 BCE</span> after Philip had captured Amphipolis, a city allied to Athens, and the Athenians were eager to prevent his taking more of their possessions (See <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2</span>;<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"> Dem. 19</span>). In this speech Demosthenes argues that — although he opposed this treaty earlier, and still thinks that it was a bad idea — Athens should accept it as an accomplished fact, do nothing to undermine it for the time being, and look for other ways to advance Athenian interests. There is a problem, though regarding this speech. The speech was written in <span class="date">346 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 5.14</span>; <span class="bibl">Raphael Sealey, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes and his Time: a study in Defeat</span> (Oxford, 1993) 157-158</span>), which makes it earlier than Demosthenes’ <span class="titlem">On the Embassy</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19</span>), which was delivered before a <span class="term">jury</span> in <span class="date">343 BCE</span> (Source for date: <span class="bibl">E. M. Harris, <span class="titlem">Aeschines and Athenian Politics</span> [Oxford, 1995]</span>). In that later speech, Demosthenes claims that Aeschines, alone, spoke in favor of allowing Philip to become a member of the Amphictyonic Council, the body that governed the shrines at Delphi and that was composed of representatives of various states (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.113</span>). But here, in <span class="titlem">On the Peace</span>, Demosthenes says that to oppose Philip in this would be dangerous. Because of this, Libanius, a <span class="date">4th century CE </span>scholar who wrote extensively on Demosthenes, says: <div class="cit"><div class="citbibl"></div><div class="citquote">It seems to me that this speech was composed, but never delivered</div></div> (<div class="cit"><div class="citbibl"></div><div class="citquote">οὗτος δὲ ὁ λόγος παρεσκευάσθαι μέν, οὐ μὴν εἰρῆσθαί μοι δοκεῖ</div></div>) (<span class="titlem"><span class="bibl">Hypothesis to the Speech ’On the Peace’</span></span><span class="bibl">, 6</span>). Would Demosthenes try to get away with such an obvious lie? Modern scholars do not agree on an answer to this question, although Sealey’s recent study assumes that Demosthenes did deliver the speech (<span class="bibl">Raphael Sealey, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes and his Time: a study in Defeat</span> (Oxford, 1993) 157-158</span>). </p>
