<p>Antiphon son of Sophilus of the deme Rhamnous (ca. <span class="date">480-411</span>) is the first of the canonical Attic orators. He was the first Athenian to compose and publish speeches written for delivery by others. Antiphon appears not to have taken an active role in Athenian politics until <span class="date">411</span>, when he masterminded the oligarchic revolution resulting in the brief reign of the <span class="term">Four Hundred</span>. When the <span class="term">Four Hundred</span> were removed from power, Antiphon was tried for treason and condemned to death (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">[Plut.] <span class="titlem">Moralia</span> 834a-b</span>) despite delivering the best defense speech in a capital case which Thucydides had ever heard (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.68</span>; for fragments of the speech see <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Gagarin fr. 1</span>).</p> 

<p>Antiphon’s surviving works include three forensic speeches (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">5</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">6</span>) and three <span class="titlem">Tetralogies</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">2</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">3</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">4</span>), all dealing with <span class="term">homicide</span>. The <span class="titlem">Tetralogies</span>, perhaps composed as early as the <span class="date">440s</span>, are sets of model speeches in hypothetical <span class="term">homicide</span> cases; each consists of two speeches for the prosecution and two for the defense. Antiphon’s forensic speeches, written for litigants in actual Athenian homicide trials, can be dated to the decade preceding his death. Although the aforementioned works all concern <span class="term">homicide</span>, the surviving fragments of Antiphon deal with a number of issues, from the tribute of Athenian allies (<span class="bibl">fr. A1-2 Maidment</span>) to a lawsuit regarding peacocks (<span class="bibl">fr. B12 Maidment</span>). In addition, ‘Antiphon the sophist,’ the author of the works <span class="titlem">On Truth</span> and <span class="titlem">On Concord</span>, is probably to be identified with Antiphon the orator. (See also Oratory.)</p>
