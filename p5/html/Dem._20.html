<div class="p">(Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Against Leptines</span>; see also Oratory). Demosthenes delivered this speech in <span class="date">355 BCE</span>, and it is the first speech he made on a public matter (Source for date: <span class="bibl">J.H. Vince, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes I</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 487</span>). The speech was delivered as part of a <span class="quote_inline">prosecution for illegal legislation</span> (<span class="foreign">γραφὴ παρανόμων</span>). The case was this: the Athenian democracy relied on its wealthy citizens to pay for certain public works; these were called ‘<span class="term">liturgies</span>’ (<span class="foreign">λειτουγίαι</span>) (see the article, <span class="term">Liturgies</span>). Occasionally, too, the democracy would honor one of its citizens by granting him immunity from <span class="term">liturgies</span>—he and his descendants would no longer be called upon to pay for a service. In <span class="date">357 BCE</span>, a man named Leptines had proposed a law that would end all such exceptions from <span class="term">liturgies</span>, thus providing Athens with additional sources of funds. The law was approved by the <span class="term">Nomothetae</span> (see also <span class="term">Assembly</span>; at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.144</span>, Demosthenes says that more than a year had elapsed between the passage of the law and the trial). Two other Athenians had brought a charge of illegal legislation against Leptines, but let the case drop (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.145</span>). A second charge was brought against the law, and Demosthenes gave this speech making the case against it. Leptines himself spoke in the law’s defense (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.146</span>). </div>
