 <p>This article was originally written for the online discussion series ‘Athenian
 Law in its Democratic Context,’ organized by Adriaan Lanni and sponsored by
 Harvard University’s <a class="link_ref" href="http://chs.harvard.edu">Center for Hellenic
 Studies</a>. Its purpose is to introduce, very briefly, the origins and development of
 Athenian democracy, from the <span class="date">6th century BCE</span> through
 the end of the <span class="date">5th century</span>. This is a companion-piece
 to the <span class="term">
 ‘Overview of Athenian Democracy,’

 Classical Athenian Democracy</span> after the discussion series has taken place.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="Introduction"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Introduction</span></h2>
 
 <p>This brief survey of the development and early history of Athenian democracy is a
 supplement to <span class="term">
 ‘Overview of Athenian Democracy,’
 </span> which appears elsewhere in this series. The first paragraphs of that article
 describe how the Greek word <span class="term">Demos</span> (<span class="foreign">δῆμος</span>,
 pronounced ‘day-moss’) has several meanings, all of them important for
 Athenian democracy. Demos is the Greek word for ‘village’ or, as it is
 often translated, ‘deme.’ The deme was the smallest administrative unit
 of the Athenian state, like a voting precinct or school district. Young men, who were 18
 years old presented themselves to officials of their deme and, having proven that they
 were not slaves, that their parents were Athenian, and that they were 18 years old, were
 enrolled in the ‘Assembly List’ (the <span class="foreign">πίναξ
 ἐκκλησιαστικός</span>) (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 44.35</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 42.1</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">Another meaning of Demos, to the Athenians, was ‘People,’ as in the
 People of Athens, the body of citizens collectively. So a young man was enrolled in his
 ‘demos’ (deme), and thus became a member of the
 ‘Demos’ (the People). As a member of the Demos, this young man could
 participate in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> of Citizens that was the
 central institution of the democracy. The Greek word for ‘Assembly’ is
 <span class="term">ekklesia</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησία</span>), but the Athenians
 generally referred to it as the ‘Demos.’ Decrees of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> began with the phrase <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the
 Demos,…</span>, very much like the phrase <span class="quote_inline">We the
 People…</span> that introduces the Constitution of the United States. In this
 context, ‘Demos’ was used to make a distinction between the <span class="term">Assembly</span> of all citizens and the <span class="term">Council</span> of 500 citizens, another institution of the democracy (see below). So
 some decrees might begin <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the <span class="term">Demos</span>…</span>, others might begin <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the
 <span class="term">Council</span>…</span>, and still others might
 begin, <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the <span class="term">Demos</span> and the <span class="term">Council</span>….</span></div>
 <p>So the Athenian Demos was the local village, the population generally, and the assembly
 of citizens that governed the state. The idea of the Demos was a potent one in Athens of the <span class="date">5th</span> and
 <span class="date">4th centuries BCE</span>.</p>
 <p>It had not always been the case. The <span class="titlem">Iliad</span>—the work of
 literature that was the shared text for all Greeks—describes a world whose
 values pre-date those of the Athenian democracy. One passage from it, especially, suggests
 that the idea of the ‘demos’ changed dramatically in the years leading
 up to the <span class="date">5th century</span>. Here, the Greek general Agamemnon has decided, for no particularly good reason, to test the
 resolve of his army. The test consisted of him suggesting that they abandon their siege of
 Troy and go home. Evidently the Greeks failed, since
 with this suggestion they rose to their feet and ran joyously to their ships. The warrior
 Odysseus, who was party to Agamemnon’s scheme, went about urging the men to return to their
 places:</p>
 <div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Whenever he encountered some king, or man of influence<br /> he would stand beside
 him and with soft words try to restrain him:<br />
 <blockquote class="quote"><p>Excellency! It does not become you to be frightened like any<br /> coward. Rather
 hold fast and check the rest of the people….</p></blockquote><br /> When he saw some
 man of the People <span class="note" id="Note1"> [<span class="term">demos</span> in
 the Greek]</span> who was shouting,<br /> he would strike at him with his staff, and
 reprove him also:<br />
 <blockquote class="quote"><p>Excellency! Sit still and listen to what others tell you,<br /> to those who are
 better men than you, you skulker and coward<br /> and thing of no account whatever in
 battle or council.<br /> Surely not all of us Achaians can be as kings here.<br /> Lordship for many is no good thing.
 Let there be one ruler,<br /> one king, to whom the son of devious-devising Kronos<br /> gives the sceptre and right of judgement, to watch
 over his people.</p></blockquote></p></blockquote><br /> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Iliad</span> 2.118-206</span>;
 R. Lattimore, trans.)</div>
 <p>The Homeric hero Odysseus did not favor putting rule into the
 hands of the Demos. What happened, then, to change the status of the Demos from that of a
 lowly mob, to be beaten down with a stick, to that of the ruling People of classical
 Athens?</p>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="Solon"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">A Reformer and a Tyrant</span></h2>
 
 <p>In the earliest history of the Greek world, as far as anyone can tell, the political
 landscape consisted of small-time ‘kings’ ruling over their own homes
 and immediate surroundings. In certain places, individual kings acquired power over larger
 territories, and influence over neighboring kings. This is what the world depicted in the
 Homeric epics looks like. </p>
 <p>The Athenians thought that the mythological hero Theseus was
 their first king, and they attributed to him the birth of the Athenian state. Before Theseus, the peninsula of Attica was home to various, independent towns and villages, with Athens being the largest. Theseus,
 when he had gained power in Athens, abolished the
 local governments in the towns; the people kept their property, but all were governed from
 a single political center at Athens. The Greeks called
 this process of bringing many settlements together into a political unity
 <span class="term">synoikism</span> (<span class="foreign">συνοίκισις</span>) (See <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 2.15.1-2</span>). Whether or not
 Theseus had anything to do with this, the fact remains that,
 when the Greek world moved from prehistory into historical times, the Attic peninsula was a unified political state with Athens at its center.</p>
 <div class="p">During the <span class="date">8th and 7th centuries BCE</span> (the <span class="date">700s and 600s</span>), Athens moved from being ruled by a king to being ruled by a small number of
 wealthy, land-owning aristocrats. Aristotle’s
 <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span>, a description of Athenian government, says
 that the status of ‘King’ (<span class="term">basileus</span>, <span class="foreign">βασιλεύς</span>) became a political office, one of three
 ‘Rulers’ or ‘
 <span class="term">Archons</span>
 ’ under the new system, and Athens came to be governed by the <span class="term">King Archon</span>, the <span class="term">War-Lord</span>, and
 the <span class="term">Archon</span> (this last sometimes called the <span class="term">Eponymous Archon</span>, because the year was identified by his name).
 <span class="quote_inline">Appointment to the supreme offices of state went by birth and wealth; and they
 were held at first for life, and afterwards for a term of ten years.</span> Later, six
 other <span class="term">Archons</span> were added to the role. These <span class="term">Nine Archons</span> ruled the Athenians, along with the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>, which consisted of all former <span class="term">Archons</span>, serving on this board for life (See <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3</span>). </div>
 <p>In the latter part of the <span class="date">7th century</span>, perhaps in
 the <span class="date">630s</span>, an Athenian named Cylon won the double foot-race at the Olympic Games and became a celebrity. He
 used his earned fame to gather a group of supporters, seized the Acropolis, and attempted to make himself tyrant of
 Athens. The attempt was a complete failure and ended
 with Cylon and his party hiding by the statue of Athene, surrounded by an angry mob. Lured out by promises of their own
 safety, Cylon and his men were killed by members of the
 aristocratic family called the Alcmeonidae (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.40.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.28.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 7.25.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 5.71</span>). This was a political crisis,
 both because of the attempted coup by an upstart and because of his murder by the
 arisocrats—he had claimed the goddess’s protection, which ought to
 have been respected. Whether this crisis brought about subsequent political changes we
 cannot tell, but it certainly left its mark on Athenian politics. The old families could
 not longer be confident in ruling at will forever, and the stain on the reputation of the
 Alcmeonidae lasted for hundreds of years—it would
 cause trouble for Pericles, an Alcmeonid, in the <span class="date">5th century</span>.</p>
 <div class="p">About ten years later, in <span class="date">621 or 620 BCE</span>, the
 Athenians enlisted a certain Draco to make new laws for them.
 According to Aristotle’s description of these
 laws, the new Consitution gave political rights to those Athenians <span class="quote_inline">who bore
 arms,</span> in other words, those Athenians wealthy enough to afford the bronze armor
 and weapons of a hoplite (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 4</span>, although some of the details given there may have
 been invented during the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>). Draco’s laws were most notable for their harshness: there
 was only one penalty prescribed, death, for every crime from murder down to loitering (see
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 17.1</span>).
 For this reason, later Athenians would find irony in the lawgiver’s name
 (‘Draco’ means ‘serpent’), and his reforms have
 given us the English word ‘draconian’.</div>
 <p>Draco’s laws did not avert the next crisis, which
 pitted the wealthy against the poor. Poor citizens, in years of poor harvests, had to
 mortgage portions of their land to wealthier citizens in exchange for food and seed to
 plant. Having lost the use of a portion of their land, they were even more vulnerable to
 subsequent hardships (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 2.1-2</span>). Eventually, many of these Athenians lost the
 use of their land altogether, and became tenant-farmers, virtually (or perhaps actually)
 slaves to the wealthy. The resulting crisis threatened both the stability and prosperity
 of Athens. In <span class="date">594</span>, however,
 the Athenians selected Solon to revise their laws.</p>
 <p>Solon’s laws, even though they did not establish a
 democracy as radical as what would follow, nevertheless became the template for all future
 Athenian government. It was common for Athenians, for the next 200 years, to describe
 subsequent legal innovations in terms of their fidelity to the ‘Solonian
 Constitution’ (whether or not those innovations remotely resembled the laws of
 Solon). So, after the brief rule of the ‘
 <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>
 ’ at the end of the <span class="date">5th century BCE</span>, when
 the Athenians were restoring their democracy, the first thing they did was to re-affirm
 the Laws of Solon, using that as a base to reconstruct their
 damaged constitution (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc.
 1.83-84</span>).</p>
 <p>Solon took steps to alleviate the crisis of debt that the poor
 suffered, and to make the constitution of Athens somewhat more equitable. He abolished the
 practice of giving loans with a citizen’s freedom as collateral, the practice
 that had made slaves of many Athenians (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 9.1</span>). He gave every Athenian the right to
 appeal to a jury, thus taking ultimate authority for interpreting the law out of the hands
 of the Nine Archons and putting it in the hands of a more democratic body, since any
 citizen could serve on a jury (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 9.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 7.3</span>). Otherwise, he divided the population
 into four classes, based on wealth, and limited the office of Archon to members of the top
 three classes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 7.3</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">Formerly, the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, which consisted
 of former <span class="term">Archons</span>, chose the <span class="term">Nine
 Archons</span> each year—a self-perpetuating system that ensured that the
 office of <span class="term">Archon</span> was held only by aristocrats. Solon had all of the Athenians elect a short-list of candidates for
 the Archonship, from which the <span class="term">Nine Archons</span> were chosen by
 lot (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 8.1</span>); the office was still limited to citizens of a certain class, but it was no
 longer limited to members of a few families. How, precisely, laws came to be passed under
 the Constitution of Solon is not entirely clear, but there was
 an <span class="term">Assembly</span>, in which every citizen could participate
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 7.3</span>), a <span class="term">Council</span> of 400 citizens chosen probably
 from the top three property classes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.4</span>), with the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> being charged with <span class="quote_inline">guarding the laws</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.4</span>).
 Regardless of the details, it does seem that the <span class="term">Archons</span>
 were still a very important element of Athenian government, since (as Aristotle notes), in subsequent years, much political strife
 seemed to focus on them (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 13.2</span>).</div>
 <p>So Athens under Solon had
 many elements that would later be a part of the radical democracy—democratic
 <span class="term">juries</span>, an <span class="term">Assembly</span> and
 a <span class="term">Council</span>, selection of officials by lot rather than by
 vote—while retaining many oligarchic elements in the form of property
 qualifications and a powerful Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>.</p>
 <p>According to the <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span> attributed traditionally to
 Aristotle, Solon himself
 was from an aristocratic family, while his personal wealth put him in the middle-class of
 Athenians, and his sympathy for the injustices against the poor made him a champion of the
 people generally. This combination was a recipe for tyranny—tyrannies were
 common in the Greek world during the <span class="date">6th century</span>, as
 certain individuals made themselves champions of the poor in order to seize
 power—but Solon was no tyrant. According to Herodotus, after formulating these new laws for a new
 Athenian Constitution, Solon made the people swear to obey them, unchanged, for ten years,
 then went abroad from Athens to avoid being badgered into changing anything (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 1.29.1</span>).</p>
 <p>Solon’s constitution did not solve all of Athens’ problems, and the city descended back into a
 state of strife, with various factions, each with its own interests, vying for power
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 1.59</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 29</span>). This state
 of affairs continued from about <span class="date">595 BCE down to 546
 BCE</span>, when an Athenian named Pisistratus, after several
 failed attempts, finally established himself as Tyrant over the Athenians.</p>
 <p>
 <span class="note" id="Note2"> [His failed attempts are interesting
 reading; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 1.59-64</span>,
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 14-16.</span>]</span>
 </p>
 <div class="p">The reign of the tyrant Pisistratus seems to have been
 relatively benign. The <span class="date">5th-century</span> historian Thucydides concluded his brief account of the tyrant’s reign
 by saying, <blockquote class="quote"><p>the city was left in full enjoyment of its existing laws, except that
 care was always taken to have the offices in the hands of some one of the family</p></blockquote>
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 6.54.6</span>). Like all
 tyrants, Pisistratus depended to a certain extent on the
 goodwill of the people for his position, and by ensuring that both rich and poor Athenians
 received fair treatment, he was able to rule for almost twenty years and die of natural
 causes (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 17.1</span>). After his death, his sons Hippias and Hipparchus continued the tyranny for
 another seventeen years. Hipparchus was assasinated in <span class="date">514 BCE</span>, and in <span class="date">510 BCE</span> the
 aristocratic Alcmeonidae family with an army from Sparta helping them, expelled Hippias and brought an end to tyranny in Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 5.62</span>;
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 6.59.4</span>).</div>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="Cleisthenes"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Cleisthenes, Democracy, and Persia</span></h2>
 
 <div class="p">After the end of the tyranny, two factions competed for power to reshape the government
 of Athens. One was led by Isagoras, whom Aristotle calls a <span class="quote_inline">friend
 of the tyrants</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 20.1</span>). The other was led by Cleisthenes, who was an Alcmeonid aristocrat (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 5.66.1</span>). Isagoras won a minor victory by getting himself chosen as <span class="term">Archon</span> in <span class="date">508</span>. But Cleisthenes, taking a page out of the tyrant’s textbook, <span class="quote_inline">took
 the People [Aristotle says ‘demos’]
 into his party</span> and used the support of the lower classes to impose a series of
 reforms (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 20.1</span>). Isagoras, using the example of recent history,
 called on the Spartan king Cleomenes to help him evict Cleisthenes from the city. While that had
 worked well for the Alcmeonidae earlier, it failed this time;
 when Isagoras and the Spartans occupied the city and tried to
 disband the government and expel seven hundred families, the Athenians rose up against
 them and drove them out (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 5.72</span>). </div>
 <p>So Cleisthenes was free to impose his reforms, which he did
 during the <span class="date">last decade of the 6th century</span>. These mark
 the beginning of classical Athenian democracy, since (with a few brief exceptions) they
 organized Attica into the political landscape that
 would last for the next two centuries. His reforms, seen broadly, took two forms: he
 refined the basic institutions of the Athenian democracy, and he redefined fundamentally
 how the people of Athens saw themselves in relation to
 each other and to the state. Since the <span class="term">Introduction to
 Athenian Democracy</span> is devoted to its various institutions, so for the moment we
 can focus on the new Athenian identity that Cleisthenes
 imposed.</p>
 <p>Cleisthenes’s reforms aimed at breaking the power of
 the aristocratic families, replacing regional loyalties (and factionalism) with
 pan-Athenian solidarity, and preventing the rise of another tyrant.</p>
 <p>Cleisthenes made the ‘deme’ or village into
 the fundamental unit of political organization and managed to convince the Athenians to
 adopt their deme-name into their own. So, where formerly an Athenian man would have
 identified himself as ‘Demochares, son of Demosthenes’, after Cleisthenes’ reforms he would have been more likely to identify
 himself as ‘Demochares from Marathon.’ Using ‘demotic’ names in place of
 ‘patronymic’ names de-emphasized any connection (or lack thereof) to
 the old arisoctratic families and emphasized his place in the new political community of
 Athens (for demes, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 21.4</span>).</p>
 <p>Each deme had a ‘demarch’, like a mayor, who was in charge of the
 deme’s most important functions (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 21.5</span>): keeping track of new citizens, as young
 men came of age (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 57.60</span>), keeping
 track of all citizens from the deme eligible to participate in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 44.35</span>), and selecting citizens from the deme each year to serve on the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 21.5</span>).</p>
 <p>The peninsula of Attica consisted of three
 more-or-less distinct geographical areas: the coast, the countryside, and the urban area
 around the city of Athens itself. Traditionally
 residents of these areas had their own concerns, and often conducted politics according to
 regional interests. To counteract this tendency, and to encourage Athenian politics to
 focus on interests common to all Athenians, Cleisthenes further
 organized the population. Each of the 139 demes he assigned to one of thirty
 <span class="term">trittyes</span> (<span class="foreign">τριττύες</span>), or
 ‘Thirds’. Ten of the Thirds were coastal, ten were in the inland, and
 ten were in and around the city.</p>
 <p>These Thirds were then assigned to ten Tribes (<span class="term">phylai</span>, <span class="foreign">φυλαί</span>), in such a way that each Tribe contained three Thirds,
 one from the coast, one from the inland, and one from the city. Each of these ten Tribes
 sent 50 citizens each year to serve on the new <span class="term">Council</span> of
 500.</p>
 <p>So, while local politics, registration of citizens and selections of candidates for
 certain offices, happened in the demes, the tribes were the units of organization that
 figured most prominently in the overall governing of Athens. Citizens from all parts of Attica worked together, within their tribes, to govern the city (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 21.3</span>).</p>
 <p>To prevent regionalism from creeping back into the system as people changed their
 address, Cleisthenes decreed that a citizen, once assigned to a
 deme, must retain that deme-affiliation even if he moved to another part of Attica (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 42.1</span>). Evidence from the <span class="date">5th</span> and <span class="date">4th centuries</span> show many people
 living in the city of Athens, but identifying themselves with rural demes. In fact, even
 the rural demes often held their meetings in Athens
 itself (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 57.10</span>). </p>
 <p>So, there was a tendency for deme-level politics to be dominated by people who had not
 moved into the city, but for national politics—service on <span class="term">juries</span>, in the <span class="term">Council</span>, and the
 magistracies—to be dominated by Athenians who, although members of demes located
 all over the peninsula, were full-time residents of the city and its immediate
 environs.</p>
 <p>To help legitimize this new division, to give it the aura of antiquity, Cleisthenes named each tribe after a <span class="term">legendary hero</span> of Athens;
 the selection of heroes was handled by the Oracle at Delphi, that is, by the god Apollo himself. The ten ‘
 <span class="term">eponymous heroes</span>
 ’ and their associated tribes were: Ajax (Aiantis), Aegeus (Aigeis), Acamas (Akamantis), Antiochus (Antiochis), Erechtheus (Erechtheis), Hippothoon (Hippothontis), Cecrops (Kekropis), Leos (Leontis),
 Oeneus (Oineis), Pandion (Pandionis). Their statues stood
 in downtown Athens, watching over the place where
 important public documents were published on billboards.</p>
 <p>All of these reforms constituted a remarkable re-shaping of Athenian society along new
 lines. Old associations, by region or according to families, were broken. <span class="term">Citizenship</span> and the ability to enjoy the rights of citizens
 were in the hands of immediate neighbors, but the governing of Athens was in the hands of the Athenian Demos as a whole, organized across
 boundaries of territory and clan. The new order was sealed as citizens adopted their
 deme-names into their own names, and as the god Apollo, speaking
 from Delphi, endorsed the new tribes.</p>
 <p>But, with the Demos newly unified and the authority of the older, more arisocratic system
 undermined, the danger of tyranny remained. Some relatives of Pisistratus survived, wealthy and still influential, in Athens, and (a new threat) the Great King of Persia was increasingly interested in bringing the Greek world into his
 empire. What was to stop a prominent citizen from gaining support with promises of power,
 and then either assuming tyrannical rule or inviting Persia to set him up as a client king?</p>
 <p>Cleisthenes sought to avert this danger by means of his most
 famous innovation: ostracism. Every year the <span class="term">Assembly</span> of
 Athenian citizens voted, by show of hands, on whether or not to hold an ostracism. If the
 <span class="term">Demos</span> voted to hold one, the ostracism took place a few
 months later, at another meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. Then,
 each citizen present scratched a name on a broken piece of pottery; these, the scrap paper
 of the ancient world, were called <span class="term">ostraka</span> (<span class="foreign">ὄστρακα</span>) in Greek, which gives us the word for the institution. If at least
 6000 citizens voted with their ostraka, the names on the pot shards were tallied, and the
 ‘winner’ was obliged to leave Athens for a period of ten years. He did not lose his property or his
 rights as an Athenian citizens, but he had to go (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.6</span>;
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 43.6</span>).</p>
 <p>The earliest subjects of ostracism were associates of Pisistratus and his sons (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.6</span>), but in later years the Athenian used
 the process to remove the leaders of various factions, both men who were regarded as
 champions of the democracy, such as Themistocles—ostracized sometime around <span class="date">470
 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc.
 1.135</span>)—and those who tended to favor more aristocratic controls on the
 power of the people, such as Cimon—ostracized around
 <span class="date">461</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc.
 4.33</span>). The most famous ostracism was that of Aristides, an aristocrat known for being fair-minded. The story goes that an
 illiterate farmer, not recognizing Aristides, asked the
 prominant man to write ‘Aristides’ on his ostrakon for him; Aristides complied, advancing his own ostracism by helping a fellow
 citizen. For the full story, which contains even more ironies that I have given here, see
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Arist.</span> 7</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 22.7</span>.</p>
 <div class="p">To be the subject of an ostracism was actually something of an honor, if an inconvenient
 one. It meant that a man was deemed too influential, too capable of persuading his fellow
 citizens, to be allowed to participate in the democratic processes of governing Athens. The list of ostracized Athenians constitutes a
 ‘Who’s Who’ of the early history of the democracy. In fact,
 the institution fell into disuse after <span class="date">416 BCE</span>, perhaps because
 of the ostracism of Hyperbolus; this man, according to the
 historian Thucydides, was ostracized <span class="quote_inline">not because
 anyone feared his power or influence, but because he was a useless wretch and a disgrace
 to the city</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.73</span>).
 The law of ostracism seems never to have been repealed, but it was never used again.</div>
 <p>Cleisthenes reformed Athens at the very end of the <span class="date">6th
 century</span>. The reforms were radical and, it seems, thoughtful. That this new social
 order and political system took hold may have been largely due to what happened in the
 <span class="date">first decades of the 5th century</span>. In <span class="date">490</span>, an expeditionary army from Persia landed in Attica, intending to
 repay the Athenians for helping the Greeks of Asia resist Persian rule. The Athenians, led
 by Miltiades, defeated the Persians against steep numerical
 odds (for the battle of Marathon, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 6.102</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 6.107-117</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.25.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.32.3</span>).</p>
 <p>The victory for the newly democratized state was doubly significant, since the Persian
 expedition had brought Hippias, the son of Pisistratus, intending to install him as tyrant over the Athenians (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 6.107</span>). This victory, and the even
 more unlikely victory against a larger Persian expedition ten years later, established
 democratic Athens as a leading power in the Greek
 world.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="Ephialtes"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">One Last Step to Democracy</span></h2>
 
 <p>One final major reform to the Athenian constitution remained before the government of
 Athens took the shape it would hold, more or less,
 for the next 150 years. In <span class="date">462</span>, an Athenian named Ephialtes led a movement to limit the power of the Council of the
 <span class="term">Areopagus</span>. The role of this Council, sometimes called
 simply the ‘
 <span class="term">Areopagus</span>
 ’, in the fully-formed democracy is discussed below, but to understand Ephialtes’ reforms we need to see, briefly, its place in
 Athenian government before Ephialtes.</p>
 <div class="p">The Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, named after the Hill of Ares in Athens, was an ancient institution. It features in the mythological history
 of Athens, as portrayed in Aeschylus’ tragedy Eumenides, in which the goddess Athene puts the
 <span class="titlem">Eumenides</span>, or <span class="titlem">Furies</span>, on trial on this Hill of Ares at Athens
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aesch. <span class="titlem">Eum.</span></span>). Aristotle says that in the time of Draco, the legendary first lawgiver of Athens, <blockquote class="quote"><p>The Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> was guardian of the laws, and kept a watch on the magistrates to
 make them govern in accordance with the laws. A person unjustly treated might lay a
 complaint before the Council of the Areopagites [the members of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>], stating the law in contravention of which he
 was treated unjustly</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 4.4</span>). The <span class="term">Areopagus</span>
 was an aristocratic institution, composed of men who were of noble birth (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 7.37</span>). It was composed of men who
 had held the office of <span class="term">archon</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.3</span>). Members
 of the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, the Areopagites
 (<span class="term">Areopagitai</span>) held office for life (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3.6</span>).
 According to Aristotle, before the time of the lawgiver
 Solon—the <span class="date">middle of
 the 6th century BCE</span>—the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>
 itself chose the men who would be <span class="term">archons</span>, and thus future
 members of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.1</span>).
 Selection of <span class="term">archons</span> was by wealth and birth (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3.6</span>),
 and so the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> preserved itself as a
 body of the aristocrats of Athens.</div>
 <p>Solon changed the method by which Athenians became <span class="term">archons</span>—forty candidates were elected, and from these
 forty, nine <span class="term">archons</span> were picked by lot (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.1</span>).
 Under the laws of Solon, the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> retained its role as overseer of the constitution;
 it could punish citizens, fine them, and spend money itself without answering to any other
 governing body; and it oversaw cases of <span class="term">impeachment</span>
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 8.4</span>). Aristotle describes the government of
 Athens under Solon as a
 blend of elements—the <span class="term">courts</span> were democratic,
 the elected <span class="term">archons</span> were aristocratic, and the Court of the
 <span class="term">Areopagus</span> was oligarchic (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span>
 1273b</span>).</p>
 <p>The Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> seems to have enjoyed a
 return to its former glory immediately after the Persian Wars. Aristotle tells the story of how, during the chaos of the Persian invasion in
 <span class="date">480 BCE</span>, the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> took a leading role in organizing, and financing, the evacuation of
 all Athenians to Salamis and the Peloponnese, which raised the body’s status
 considerably (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 23.1</span>). He goes on to say that the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> enjoyed preeminence in Athens for almost two decades, until the time when Conon was <span class="term">archon</span>, and Ephialtes brought about his reforms in <span class="date">462</span> BCE (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.1</span>). </p>
 <p>According to Aristotle, Ephialtes brought about a reform of the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> by denouncing the Court before the <span class="term">Council</span> and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.4</span>).
 So the reform was not, finally, the work of Ephialtes alone,
 but an act of <span class="term">legislation</span> by two of the more democratic
 institutions in Athens. Aristotle connects this event to a newfound feeling of power among the common
 people of Athens following the Persian Wars, when the
 less wealthy citizens by serving in the navy had saved the city. He makes the connection
 between naval victories and the reform of the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> explicitly in his <span class="titlem">Politics</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1274a</span>),
 and the <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span> that survives under
 Aristotle’s name strongly suggests the connection as well (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 27.1</span>).</p>
 <p>By <span class="date">462</span> BCE, when Ephialtes made his
 reforms, the <span class="term">archons</span> (the future members of the Court of
 the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>) were chosen by lot, not by vote (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.5</span>).
 It is possible that this change made the institution seem less prestigious, and thus
 worthy of holding fewer powers. This interesting suggestion is from <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">P.J. Rhodes, <span class="titlem">A Commentary on the Aristotelian <span class="titlem">Athenaion
 Politeia</span></span> (Oxford, 1993)</span>.</p>
 <div class="p">By means of Ephialtes’ reforms, according to Aristotle, the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> was <span class="quote_inline">deprived of the superintendence of affairs</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 26.1</span>).
 When Aristotle describes the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> as it was in the <span class="date">4th
 century</span>, over a hundred years after Ephialtes, he says
 that it had authority over trials of murder, wounding, death by poison, and arson, but
 that other similar crimes—involuntary manslaughter, murder of slaves or
 foreigners, accidental killings, or killings in self-defense—come before other
 <span class="term">courts</span>, the <span class="term">Court of the
 Palladium</span> or the <span class="term">Court of the Delphinium</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.3</span>).
 The <span class="term">Areopagus</span> also conducted investigations of political
 corruption, presenting its findings to the <span class="term">Council</span> and
 <span class="term">Assembly</span> for any further action (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.83</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.81</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.4</span>). From this, then, we can perhaps
 get a sense of how Ephialtes diminished the role of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>; the aristocratic body that once had the power to
 nullify laws and remove candidates from office was reduced to a murder court and
 investigative body, albeit a highly respected one.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="Fifth_Century"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">The <span class="date">Fifth Century</span>: Democracy stumbles
 twice</span></h2>
 
 <p>The <span class="date">5th century BCE</span> was marked by the extended
 conflict—sometimes ‘cold’ and often overt—between
 Athens and Sparta, but involving most of the Greek world and the Persian Empire as
 well. That history is readily available elsewhere. For our purposes, there are three
 things especially worth mentioning from the period.</p>
 <p>First was the generalship of Pericles. The office of
 ‘General’, or <span class="term">Strategos</span> (<span class="foreign">στρατηγός</span>), was one of the few in the Athenian democracy that was elected,
 rather than chosen randomly by lot; the reasons for this should be obvious (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.4</span>).
 It was also the only office which an Athenian could hold for multiple successive terms.
 And, the Generals—there were ten in each year—enjoyed certain powers
 that made this office (at least potentially) a platform from which an Athenian could wield
 extraordinary influence over the affairs and policies of the city. A general could
 introduce business for discussion in a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> on his own authority, without going through normal channels (the
 evidence for this comes from inscriptions: <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">SEG</span> 10
 86.47</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 27</span>;
 the ‘normal channels’ are discussed below).</p>
 <p>Pericles was elected repeatedly to the office of Strategos
 during the period from <span class="date">454 to 429 BCE</span> (though not for
 every year during that period, which is interesting). From within this office, he was able
 to address the Athenians meeting in their <span class="term">Assembly</span> on
 matters he deemed important, and to persuade them toward policies of his own devising. The
 two most noteworthy results were the so-called ‘Periclean Building
 Program’, which produced the monumental architecture we see today on the Athenian Acropolis, and the expansion of
 Athenian imperialism. The latter, eventually, brought about a war between Athens and Sparta that, in
 one form or another, lasted (at least) from <span class="date">431</span> BCE until
 Athens’ defeat in <span class="titlem">404</span>
 BCE.</p>
 <div class="p">The historian Thucydides, himself an Athenian General
 who helped pursue the war against Sparta, offers this
 characterization of Pericles’ leadership:
 <blockquote class="quote"><p>Pericles indeed, by his rank, ability, and known
 integrity, was enabled to exercise an independent control over the Demos—in
 short, to lead them instead of being led by them; for as he never sought power by
 improper means, he was never compelled to flatter them, but, on the contrary, enjoyed so
 high an estimation that he could afford to anger them by contradiction. Whenever he saw
 them unseasonably and insolently elated, he would with a word reduce them to alarm; on
 the other hand, if they fell victims to a panic, he could at once restore them to
 confidence. In short, what was nominally a democracy became in his hands government by
 the first citizen.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 2.65.8-9</span>). What is most important to remember, though, is that Pericles was merely one of ten elected Generals. His
 ‘policies’ came into effect merely because his office afforded him a
 platform from which to address the Demos, and his evident talents as a speaker allowed him
 to persuade the Demos to adopt his ideas as their own.</div>
 <p>In <span class="date">415</span>, after an interlude of relative peace in the war between
 Athens and Sparta, the Demos of Athens undertook
 an invasion of Sicily. This adventure was an utter
 disaster, resulting in the destruction of an Athenian fleet and an army of Athenian
 citizens either killed outright or doomed to work to death in the quarries of Syracuse. In the aftermath, certain citizens took steps to
 move the government of the city away from the radical democracy that—they
 thought—was leading the city to ruin. Their first step was to work, through
 constitutional channels, to establish a small body of ‘Preliminary
 Councilors’, who would limit the topics that could be addressed by the more
 democratic <span class="term">Council</span> and <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc.
 8.1.3-4</span>).</p>
 <p>Shortly thereafter, in <span class="date">411</span> BCE, the Athenians brought an end to
 their democracy and instituted an oligarchy by, first, appointing ten
 ‘Commissioners’ who were charged with re-writing the constitution of
 Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.67.1</span>). Aristotle says that there were twenty of these, and that
 they were in addition to the ten Preliminary Councilors already in office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 29.2</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">These Commissioners proposed a new <span class="term">Council</span>,
 consisting of 400 men, with service limited to the wealthier citizens. Five men would be
 selected as ‘Presidents’, and these would choose 100 men for the new
 <span class="term">Council</span>, and each of those 100 would choose three
 others, thus creating the Council of ‘400’, or 405 in reality (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.67.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 29.5</span>).
 This new government claimed that a <span class="term">Council</span> of 400
 was <span class="quote_inline">according to the ancestral constitution</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 31.1</span>).
 This <span class="term">Council</span> of 400 would have the power to choose
 5000 Athenians who would be the only citizens eligible to participate in assemblies (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.67.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 29.5</span>).</div>
 <p>Thucydides describes how this new <span class="term">Council</span> of 400 collected an armed gang, confronted the
 democratic <span class="term">Council</span>, paid them their stipends, and
 sent them home (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.69.4</span>;
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 32.1</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">This oligarchic government lasted only four months before it was replaced by another
 government in which the power was in the hands of 5000 Athenians — more
 democratic, but still a far cry from the radical democracy defined by Cleisthenes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 33.1</span>). That government, in turn, lasted only a short time before
 <span class="quote_inline">the People quickly seized control of the constitution from them</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 34.1</span>).</div>
 <p>The democracy was restored, but only briefly. In <span class="date">404</span> BCE, the
 Spartans caught the Athenian fleet on the beach at Aegospotamoi (‘Goat Islands’) and destroyed it. After a
 period of seige, while the Spartans blockaded the harbors of Athens, the city surrendered, and its fortunes fell into the hands of the
 so-called <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>. These were Athenians
 selected by the Spartans to form a puppet government by the Spartans. (For the end of the
 Peloponnesian War, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
 <span class="titlem">Alc.</span> 36.4-37.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Lys.</span> 9.4-11</span>;
 for the establishment of the <span class="term">Tyrants</span>, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Lys.</span> 15.5</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.2.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 3.5.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 9.11.6</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.3.11</span>)</p>
 <div class="p">Like the Oligarchy of <span class="date">411</span>, the tyranny of the <span class="term">Thirty</span> lasted only one year before pro-democracy forces
 regained control of the city’s affairs (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Lys.</span> 21</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.4.2</span>). After
 the tyrants were overthrown and the city returned to democratic rule, Athens once again compiled and codified its old laws with this
 decree, which summarizes the accumulated law and tradition of the first century of the
 Athenian democratic experiment: <blockquote class="quote"><p>On the motion of Teisamenus the <span class="term">People</span> decreed that Athens be governed as of old, in accordance with the laws of
 Solon, his weights and his measures, and in accordance with
 the statutes of Draco, which we used in times past. Such
 further laws as may be necessary shall be inscribed upon tables by the <span class="term">Law-Givers</span> elected by the <span class="term">Council</span> and named hereafter, exposed before the Tribal Statutes for all to
 see, and handed over to the <span class="term">magistrates</span> during the
 present month. The laws thus handed over, however, shall be submitted beforehand to the
 scrutiny of the <span class="term">Council</span> and the five hundred <span class="term">Law-Givers</span> elected by the Demes, when they have taken
 their oath. Further, any private citizen who so desires may come before the <span class="term">Council</span> and suggest improvements in the laws. When the laws
 have been ratified, they shall be placed under the guardianship of the Council of the
 <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, to the end that only such laws as have
 been ratified may be applied by magistrates. Those laws which are approved shall be
 inscribed upon the wall, where they were inscribed aforetime, for all to see</p></blockquote>
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.83-84</span>). The Athenians
 also passed a law of general amnesty, to prevent an endless cycle of retribution for
 wrongs committed on both sides of the recent civil strife (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 2.4.43</span>).</div>
 <p>An inscription (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 105</span>)
 survives that records a law limiting the <span class="term">Council</span>’s authority. After two anti-democratic revolutions, this law
 says that in matters of war and peace, death sentences, large fines, disenfranchisement
 (that is, loss of <span class="term">citizenship</span>), the administration of
 public finances, and foreign policy the <span class="term">Council</span> cannot act
 without the approval of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> of the People.</p>
 <p>With this restoration, Athens reestablished a
 radically democratic government. The following description of the institutions of
 Athens will focus on the democracy as it was in the
 <span class="date">4th century</span>, in its fully developed form, attested
 by the best evidence.</p>
