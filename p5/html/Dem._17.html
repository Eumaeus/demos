<div class="p">(Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">On the Treaty with Alexander</span>; see also Oratory). This is a speech, delivered before the Athenian <span class="term">Assembly</span>, on the subject of Alexander of Macedon (later known as Alexander the Great). After Alexander’s father, Philip of Macedon, was assasinated in <span class="date">336 BCE</span>, Alexander had to establish himself as his father’s successor, not only in Macedonia, but in the eyes of the Greeks. Philip had forced the Greek cities (including Athens, but excepting Sparta) to join in an alliance, with himself as supreme commander of all allied military forces. In <span class="date">335</span>, Alexander, the new Macedonian king re-affirmed the earlier treaty and established himself the leader of the allied Greek cities. This speech, delivered in the Athenian <span class="term">Assembly</span> probably very soon after the new treaty was ratified, complains of how Alexander abused the terms of the treaty, and calls on Athens to go to war with him. The ancient scholar Libanius does not think that the speech is actually by Demosthenes, but assigns it to Hyperides instead: <blockquote class="quote"><p>This speech seems to be falsely attributed. For it does not seem like the other speeches of Demosthenes in its style, but seems more like the speeches of Hyperides, for a number of reasons, but especially because it has some vocabulary that is more common in Hyperides than in Demosthenes, words like ‘<span class="foreign"> νεόπλουτοι</span>’ and ‘<span class="foreign">βδελυρεύεσθαις</span>’</p></blockquote> (<blockquote class="quote"><p>ὁ δὲ λόγος ψευδεπίγραφος εἶναι δοκεῖ. οὐ γὰρ ἔοικε κατὰ τὴν ἰδέαν τοῖς ἄλλοις τοῖς τοῦ Δημοσθένους, ἀλλὰ τῷ Ὑπερίδου χαρακτῆρι μᾶλλον προσχωρεῖ τά τε ἄλλα καὶ λέξεις τινὰς ἔχει κατ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἐκεῖνον μᾶλλον εἰρημένας ἢ τὸν Δημοσθένην, οἷον νεόπλουτοι καὶ βδελυρεύεσθαι</p></blockquote>) (<span class="bibl">Lib. Arg. Orat. Dem. 16</span>; see also Ancient Scholarship). (Source for dates: <span class="bibl">J.H. Vince, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes I</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 463</span>). </div>
