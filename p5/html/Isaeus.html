<div class="Description" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Isaeus</span></h2>

<p>Born about <span class="date">420 BCE</span>, died during the <span class="date">340s BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>), thought either to be from Chalcis in Euboea or from Athens. Due to his non-participation in political affairs, it has been asserted that Isaeus was a resident alien, or metic (<span class="foreign">μέτοικος</span>). This theory would lend credence to the assertion that he was originally from Chalcis. Much of our knowledge of Isaeus comes from the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">De Isaeo</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">On Isaeus</span>) of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a literary critic who lived during the reign of the Roman emperor Augustus (<span class="date">31 BCE - 14 CE</span>; source for date, <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). In the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">De Isaeo</span>, Hermippus of Smyrna (<span class="date">c. 200 BCE</span>) (source for date: <span class="bibl">E.S. Forster, <span class="titlem">Isaeus</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1943] vii</span>) is quoted saying that Isaeus was a student of Isocrates and the teacher of Demosthenes. Isaeus would have been among the earliest students of Isocrates, who opened his academy at Athens around <span class="date">392 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl">E.S. Forster, <span class="titlem">Isaeus</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1943] ix</span>). According to the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Lives of the Ten Orators</span></span>, which is attributed to Plutarch, there are a total of 64 speeches and one handbook of rhetoric that were attributed to Isaeus. Eleven of his speeches remain intact today (all of which deal with cases of inheritance), while the titles and some small fragments of 43 others survive as well. (See also the genre of Oratory.)</p>
