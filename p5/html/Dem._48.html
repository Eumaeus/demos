<p>Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Against Olympiodorus</span>, see also Oratory. This is a speech written on behalf of the plaintiff, Callistratus, who is suing his brother-in-law, Olympiodorus. Callistratus, upon the death of his relative Comon (the family relationship is not specified), agreed with Olympiodorus to split the estate in half, each man keeping an equal share. The two men wrote articles of agreement and made oaths binding themselves to this pact (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 48.9</span>). Their agreement held until it was discovered that a slave of Comon, Moschion, had stolen a portion of Comon’s money. Moschion had been a trusted servant of Comon, but had taken advantage of Comon’s trust by stealing first 1000 drachmas (see also <span class="term">Money</span>) and later 70 minas. According to their agreement, when it was discovered that some of the money was missing, Callistratus and Olympiodorus agreed to put the slave Moschion to torture, but he voluntarily admitted to the theft of 1000 drachmas. He did not, however, mention the taking of the 70 minas. Moschion was ordered to pay back the money that he had admitted to stealing; in total, he paid back about 600 drachmas (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 48.17</span>), which was divided equally between Callistratus and Olympiodorus according to their agreement. Later, Olympiodorus actually placed the slave under torture, this time without the consent of Callistratus. While under torture, the slave Moschion admitted to the theft of the seventy minas. He had not spent any of it and so he returned the entire sum to Olympiodorus. Olympiodorus, though, kept all of the money that he recovered from Moschion without splitting it evenly with Callistratus, as their agreement had required (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 48.19-20</span>). At the same time that these events were taking place, a flurry of claimants to the estate of Comon appeared to press their claims in court. Olympiodorus and Callistratus went to court and lost the judgement and, consequently, the estate of Comon was awarded to other claimants. They then decided to enter separate suits against the other claimants; Olympiodorus sued for the entire estate, Callistratus for half. The result of these lawsuits was that Olympiodorus was awarded the estate. According to the original agreement between he and Callistratus, he was to split the estate in half (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 48.31</span>). Olympiodorus refused to do this and the present lawsuit was the result of his refusal. This speech, because it takes place during the archonship of Pythodotus, can be dated to <span class="date">343 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl">A.T. Murray, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes II</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 349</span>).</p>
