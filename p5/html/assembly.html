<div class="Summary" id="Summary"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Summary</span></h2>

<p>The Assembly (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησία</span>) was the regular gathering of male Athenian <span class="term">citizens</span> (women also enjoyed the status of ‘<span class="term">citizen</span>,’ but without political rights) to listen to, discuss, and vote on decrees that affected every aspect of Athenian life, both public and private, from financial matters to religious ones, from public festivals to war, from treaties with foreign powers to <span class="bibl">regulations</span> governing ferry boats.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Introduction"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Introduction</span></h2>


<div class="p">The Assembly (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησία</span>) was the regular opportunity for all male <span class="term">citizens</span> of Athens to speak their minds and exercise their votes regarding the government of their city. It was the most central and most definitive institution of the Athenian Democracy. Before <span class="date">462 BCE</span>, the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> controlled legislation in Athens, but in that year Ephialtes instituted a reform that diminished the power of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> and increased the power of the Assembly of the people (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 27.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
 15.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.5</span>). This Assembly became synonymous with democracy. When Aristotle describes how democratic government was restored after Sparta defeated Athens in 404 BCE he says that this restoration happened when <span class="quote_inline">the <span class="term">People</span> became sovereign over affairs</span> (<span class="foreign">ὅτε δὲ κύριος ὁ δῆμος γενόμενος τῶν πραγμάτων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.1</span>). Under this government, he says, the <span class="term">People</span> administers all business <span class="quote_inline">by decrees and by <span class="term">law-courts</span></span> (<span class="foreign">ψηφίσμασιν καὶ δικαστηρίοις</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.2</span>). When Aristotle mentions the <span class="term">People</span> and government by decrees, he is describing the Assembly.</div>

<div class="p">In the Assembly each male <span class="term">citizen</span> of Athens could speak, regardless of his station. The orator Aeschines says that the herald (<span class="foreign">κῆρυξ</span>), acting as a sergeant-at-arms, <blockquote class="quote"><p>does not exclude from the platform the man whose ancestors have not held a general’s office, nor even the man who earns his daily bread by working at a trade; nay, these men he most heartily welcomes, and for this reason he repeats again and again the invitation, <span class="quote_inline">Who wishes to address the assembly?</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.27</span>) Demosthenes can chide his fellow Athenians for failing to recollect certain events, because they <span class="quote_inline">were present at every assembly, as the state proposed a discussion of policy in which every one might join.</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.273</span>) <span class="quote_inline">Everyone</span>, in this context, refers to the body of <span class="term">citizens</span> who were registered on the assembly list (<span class="foreign">πίνακα τὸν ἐκκλησιαστικὸν</span>) for their local district, or deme (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 44.35</span>). Under the Democracy of Aristotle’s time (after 330 BCE), young men were enrolled on this list when they were 18 years old (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 42.1</span>), then spent two years as military cadets, or <span class="term">ephebes</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 42.4</span>), after which they were members of the <span class="term">citizen</span> body (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 42.5</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Of course, some people might be better qualified than others to speak on certain subjects, and the <span class="term">citizens</span> of Athens could be very critical when anyone tried to speak outside of his expertise. The character Socrates in Plato’s <span class="titlem">Protagoras</span> says that when the Athenian Assembly discusses construction, the <span class="term">citizens</span> call for builders to speak, and when it discusses the construction of ships they call for shipwrights, <blockquote class="quote"><p>but if anyone else, whom the people do not regard as a craftsman, attempts to advise them, no matter how handsome and wealthy and well-born he may be, not one of these things induces them to accept him; they merely laugh him to scorn and shout him down, until either the speaker retires from his attempt, overborne by the clamor, or the <span class="term">archers</span> (<span class="foreign">τοξόται</span>) pull him from his place or turn him out altogether by order of the presiding officials (<span class="foreign">κελευόντων τῶν πρυτάνεων</span>)</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Prot.</span>
 319b-c</span>). But, Socrates continues, when the discussion is not about technical matters but about the governing of the city, <blockquote class="quote"><p>the man who rises to advise them on this may equally well be a smith, a shoemaker, a merchant, a sea-captain, a rich man, a poor man, of good family or of none</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Prot.</span> 319d</span>).</div>

<p>There is the question of participation by Athenians living in the countryside of Attica, outside the city of Athens. While these people were certainly <span class="term">citizens</span> of Athens, it may often have been difficult for them to attend a meeting of the Assembly. This would have been especially true when emergency meetings were called on short notice, such as the occasion that Demosthenes describes, when news of a military disaster came to the city in the evening, and a special Assembly convened the very next morning (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.169</span>). This assembly, and any others like it, must have consisted mainly of <span class="term">citizens</span> living close to the city. And even when there was more warning before a meeting, we have to wonder how many Athenians living in the countryside of Attica would have made a 50 or 60 mile round trip to downtown Athens and back. In <span class="date">400 BCE</span> we can estimate that there were between 20,000 and 30,000 male <span class="term">citizens</span> in Athens—it is beyond the scope of this article to give evidence and justification for this, but the arguments are presented in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Victor Ehrenberg, <span class="titlem">The Greek State</span>, 2nd English Edition (Methuen, 1969) 31</span>, whose estimate is 20,000-25,000, and in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">A.W. Gomme, <span class="titlem">The Population of Athens in the Fifth and Fourth Centuries B.C.</span> (Blackwell, 1933) 26</span>, whose estimate is 22,000—but the number of Athenians in attendance at a given meeting seems to have been considerably lower. Thucydides makes the statement that during the Peloponnesian War (331 - 404 BCE) there were usually only 5000 people at a meeting (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.72</span>), although he may be exaggerating downwards; a better measure of regular attendance might be the fact that 6000 <span class="term">citizens</span> were required for a valid vote conferring <span class="term">citizenship</span> on a non-Athenian (the earliest evidence for this rule dates from 369 BCE) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2
 103</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.45</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.89</span>).</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="FreedomToSpeak"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Freedom to Speak</span></h2>

<div class="p">The Assembly met so that the male <span class="term">citizens</span> could discuss the affairs of the city, and such discussion required that each <span class="term">citizen</span> have freedom to speak his mind. This freedom was vital to the proper functioning of the Assembly, whether the issue at stake was some important public policy (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 15.1</span>), or the rights of a single <span class="term">citizen</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.3</span>). In an anecdote from the distant past, Demosthenes suggests that freedom of speech had a long history at Athens, and that it persisted despite periodic attempts to limit it. He recounts how in the 6th century BCE the island of Salamis had revolted from Athenian control, and the Athenians had forbidden anyone to propose a war to recover the island; but Solon, a real person whose place in Athenian history became subject of legend, composed a poem on the subject (poetry on the subject was evidently not forbidden), and through this ruse got around the law and convinced Athens to fight for Salamis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.252</span>). By the 4th century BC, discussions of motions in the Assembly were opened with a general invitation to all the male <span class="term">citizens</span>, as the Herald (<span class="foreign">κῆρυξ</span>) asked, <span class="quote_inline">Who wishes to speak?</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.191</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.26</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Ach.</span>
 46</span>). We might note, here, that Demosthenes claims a certain freedom of speech to have extended even to resident foreigners and <span class="term">slaves</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 9.3</span>), although he is certainly not talking about participation in the Assembly, and we should wonder how much freedom these people actually enjoyed.</div>

<p>This freedom to speak was not absolute or without regulation. Aeschines tells us, for example, that in the early democracy (before the 5th century) <span class="term">citizens</span> over 50 years of age could speak first, and only after those had their say could younger men speak (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.23</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.2</span>). Other formal restrictions could apply, such as decrees limiting discussion of certain topics to certain meetings of the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.109</span>), or even laws forbidding discussion of issues already settled in a court (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.54</span>). Other, less legitimate (but perhaps more effective) limits could be imposed: the crowd might raise a clamor and refuse to listen to a speaker advocate an unpopular proposal (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.111</span>), and this seems to have happened often enough that orators regularly asked, beforehand, not to be shouted down (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 13.14</span>).</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Exclusion"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Exclusion from the Assembly</span></h2>

<div class="p">Individual <span class="term">citizens</span> could lose the right to participate in the Assembly by committing various offenses (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.23</span>). Demosthenes mentions legal penalties for people who attend a meeting of the Assembly while owing a debt to the public treasury (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.123</span>), or who have been stricken, for some reason or another, from their deme’s register of <span class="term">citizens</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.132</span>). Also prohibited from participating were: anyone convicted of prostituting himself (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.72</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.21</span>; and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.32</span>, where the orator adds, <span class="quote_inline">however well he speaks</span>), anyone who beat his father or mother, or failed to support them, or who threw away his shield in battle, or who squandered his inheritance (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.28</span> - <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.30</span>). Any <span class="term">citizen</span> who suspected another of being unqualified to participate in the Assembly could challenge him to <span class="term">dokimasia</span>, or <span class="quote_inline">scrutiny</span> (<span class="foreign">δοκιμασία</span>), whereupon the issue would be decided by a <span class="term">jury</span> in a <span class="term">law-court</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.32</span>).
</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Payment"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">Payment for Participation</span></h2>

<div class="p"><span class="term">Citizens</span> were paid for attending the Assembly, to ensure that even the poor could afford to take time from their work to participate in their own government. Aristotle recognized that inclusion of all <span class="term">citizens</span> and freedom to speak are not the only hallmarks of a democratic constitution, but that the most democratic states pay their <span class="term">citizens</span> for attending the Assembly. He claims that in the absence of payment, the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="foreign">βουλή</span>) is the most democratic of magistracies (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span>
 1317b</span>), but in states that can afford to, and do, pay their <span class="term">citizens</span> for attending meetings of the Assembly, <span class="quote_inline">all the <span class="term">citizens</span> actually take part in it and exercise their <span class="term">citizenship</span>, because even the poor are enabled to be at leisure by receiving pay</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span>
 1293a</span>). A historical anecdote recorded in Aristotle’s <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span> further supports this assertion: In 411, when a group of Athenians temporarily overthrew the democracy and established an oligarchy, one of their first acts was to pass a law that no one should receive pay for political activity (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 29.5</span>; and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 33.1</span>, referring to the subsequent regime of 411 and 410). In the 4th century, when Timocrates had proposed that the Athenians loosen enforcement of penalties against those who owe debts to the state, Demosthenes claimed that there would be no money left in the treasury to pay for attendance at the Assembly, and he went on to equate that outcome with an end to Democracy (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.99</span>).</div>

<p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 4.2</span> says that under the ‘Constitution of Draco’, a mostly legendary period in the history of pre-democratic Athens, <span class="term">citizenship</span> was limited to those who could afford to arm themselves. Under the laws instituted by Solon in the 6th century, the Athenians were divided into four property classes, and only those who possessed a certain amount of property could hold office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 7.4</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 30</span>). This property qualification survived into the 4th century, but came to be disregarded — in the 4th century, candidates for office were asked about their property class, but everyone simply claimed to belong to the higher classes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 7.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 47.1</span>). Demosthenes mentions Theogenes of Cothocidae, who was appointed to the office of <span class="term">Archon Basileus</span>, although he was so poor that his friends had to help him meet the expenses that went along with taking office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.72</span>).</p>

<div class="p">But even under the old system, where only the wealthy could hold office, we do not hear of any property qualification for participating in the Assembly; even the poorest <span class="term">citizens</span> were eligible to meet on the Pnyx and speak their minds. As Athens became increasingly democratic, the city began to pay its <span class="term">citizens</span> to attend the Assembly, first one obol per meeting, then two, then three (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.3</span>). A character in one of Aristophanes’ comedies (produced in the early 4th century) complains that <span class="quote_inline">in the old days,</span> when the pay was only one obol, all the <span class="term">citizens</span> stayed at home, but now that the pay is three obols, meetings are too crowded (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Eccl.</span>
 302</span>; see also the parody of the 3-obol payment at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Eccl.</span>
 44</span>). In Aristophanes there are several jokes about people getting to the Assembly too late to receive their pay, which suggests that <span class="term">citizens</span> had to be present at the beginning of the meeting in order to receive pay, or perhaps that only the first 6000 <span class="term">citizens</span> to arrive got paid (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Eccl.</span>
 290</span>;<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Eccl.</span> 385</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Eccl.</span>
 395</span>). The rate seems to have remained at 3 obols until around 388, if we can trust a passing reference in Aristophanes’ <span class="titlem">Wealth</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Pl.</span>
 330</span>) (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3, <span class="term">s.v.</span> ‘Aristophanes’</span>). By the 330s and 320s, the payment had increased to one drachma (six obols) for an ordinary meeting, and a drachma and a half (nine obols) for a <span class="quote_inline">sovereign assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">κυρία ἐκκλησία</span>, see below) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 62.2</span>). Demosthenes mentions, in a rather vague passage, that taxation alone was not sufficient to pay for the expense of holding meetings of the Assembly, and that various laws ensured supplemental income for that purpose (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.97</span>).
</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="MeetingPlaces"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">Meeting Places</span></h2>

<div class="p">The traditional meeting-place for the Assembly was the open space on top of the hill of the Pnyx, (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.97</span>), and the Pnyx seems to have been considered the proper place for the business of the Assembly: Aeschines mentions a law requiring that anyone awarded a crown by the Assembly be given the crown on the Pnyx and nowhere else (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.34</span>). In fact, if we compare <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.34</span>, which specifies that the crown be awarded <span class="quote_inline">on the Pnyx</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐς τὴν Πύκνα</span>), with <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.32</span>, which specifies that it be awarded <span class="quote_inline">in the Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ</span>), we might conclude that <span class="quote_inline">Assembly</span> and <span class="quote_inline">Pnyx</span> were used synonymously. The Pnyx was open to the sky, and thus meetings of the Assembly must have been influenced by the weather; the laws that mandated <span class="quote_inline">good weather omens</span> before the election of military officers (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.4</span>) might have been as interested in ensuring a comfortable day for discussion as in ascertaining divine favor.</div>

<div class="p">When the Assembly was to meet on the Pnyx, <span class="quote_inline">hurdles</span> (<span class="foreign">τὰ γέρρα</span>) were set up on the hill to separate the <span class="term">citizens</span>, meeting in the Assembly, from non-<span class="term">citizens</span>, who presumably would gather as spectators (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.90</span>). Hurdles were also set up in the marketplace (<span class="foreign">ἀγορά</span>) before meetings of the Assembly, perhaps to channel <span class="term">citizens</span> toward the Pnyx (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.169</span>). In 5th century comedy we also find jokes about people in the marketplace fleeing a <span class="quote_inline">red rope</span> (<span class="foreign">τὸ σχοινίον φεύγουσι τὸ μεμιλτωμένον</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Ach.</span>
 20</span>), a rope dipped in wet red paint, which seems to have been used to herd people out of the marketplace and to the Assembly. In the 4th century, when payment for attendance was sufficient motivation to ensure attendance, this red rope seems to have been used to keep people out of a meeting that was already full (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Eccl.</span>
 379</span>).</div>

<div class="p">But the Pnyx was clearly not the only place at which an Assembly could convene. Before a meeting of the Assembly, the Prytanies (<span class="foreign">οἱ πρυτανεύοντες</span>) were supposed to post the upcoming meeting’s agenda and the location of the meeting (<span class="foreign">ὅπου καθίζειν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.3</span>). Demosthenes mentions a law (<span class="foreign">νόμος</span>) mandating a meeting of the Assembly in the Theater of Dionysus on the day after the Festival of All-Zeus, (the <span class="foreign">Πάνδια</span>); this assembly is to deal with, first, any religious matters, and then hear any complaints that arise from the procession or contests at the festival (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.8</span>). Aeschines mentions a session of the Assembly held in the Theater of Dionysus after the festival of the City Dionysia (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.61</span>). He also reports a <span class="quote_inline">vote of censure</span> (<span class="foreign">καταχειροτονία</span>) being passed against a certain Meidias in the Theater of Dionysus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.52</span>).

<div class="Section" id="Schedule"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">Schedule of Meetings</span></h2>

<p>In the <span class="date">4th century</span>, there were 40 regularly scheduled meetings of the Assembly each year, four in each <span class="term">prytany</span> (each <span class="term">prytany</span> was one tenth of the year) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.3</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 336a</span>).</p>

<div class="p">One of the four meetings in each <span class="term">prytany</span> was the <span class="quote_inline">Sovereign Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">κυρία ἐκκλησία</span>), the agenda for which included the confirmation of magistrates currently serving, issues of the food supply and defense, announcements of private property to be confiscated, and announcements of lawsuits regarding inheritance (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.4</span>).</div>

<div class="p">In each prytany, there were three regular assemblies in addition to the ‘Sovereign Assembly’ (<span class="foreign">κυρία ἐκκλησία</span>); these were simply called <span class="quote_inline">Assemblies</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησίαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.3</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 330</span>). It seems likely that in the <span class="date">5th century</span> only the Sovereign Assemblies were regularly scheduled, because Thucydides mentions a period of 40 days in the year <span class="date">431</span>
 in which there was no Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 2.22.1</span>); if there were four scheduled assemblies in each <span class="term">prytany</span> at that time, 40 days could not have passed without a meeting.</div>

<p>Apart from the Sovereign Assembly, one of the remaining three was an occasion for any <span class="term">citizen</span> who wished to present a suppliant-branch (<span class="foreign">ἱκετηρία</span>) and address his fellow <span class="term">citizens</span> about any public or private matter that concerned him (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.6</span>). The ability of <span class="term">citizens</span> to voice complaints in this public forum may have deterred certain bad behavior, or at least made the perpetrators think twice. Aeschines recounts how some men assaulted a man named Pittalacus; on the next day Pittalacus went to the marketplace, and his attackers came up to him and tried to placate him, because there was to be an Assembly that day, and they were afraid that the whole city would learn of their crime (<span class="foreign">φοβηθέντες ὅ τε Ἡγήσανδρος καὶ ὁ Τίμαρχος μὴ ἀνακηρυξθῇ αὐτῶν ἡ βδελυρία εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν πόλιν παρ᾽, ἐπῄει δὲ ἐκκλησία</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.60</span>).</p>

<div class="p">The other two regularly scheduled meetings in each <span class="term">prytany</span> were concerned, according to Aristotle, with <span class="quote_inline">other things</span> (<span class="foreign">περὶ τῶν ἄλλων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.6</span>). Some of this other business was scheduled to happen at particular assemblies during the year. At an assembly held on the 11th day of the first <span class="term">prytany</span>, the people voted on whether or not to hold a review of all the laws (<span class="foreign">νόμοι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>). In the 6th <span class="term">prytany</span>, there was discussion of whether or not to hold an <span class="term">ostracism</span>, discussion of any information against people charged with being informers (<span class="foreign">συκοφαντῶν προβολάς</span>) — in this category, no more than three <span class="term">citizens</span> and three metics — and discussion of people accused of failing to perform some assigned public service (<span class="foreign">κἄν τις ὑποσχόμενός τι μὴ ποιήσῃ τῷ δήμῳ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.5</span>). A meeting during the 6th <span class="term">prytany</span> was also the occasion for election of military officers (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.4</span>).</div>

<p>At least until the <span class="date">middle of the 4th century</span> the Assembly occasionally met to conduct a trial, most often an <span class="term">impeachment</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 49.10</span>). This is a complex matter, since the laws regarding impeachment were revised during the 4th century. For a full discussion, see the article on <span class="term">Impeachment</span>.</p>

<p>Assemblies do not seem to have taken place on fixed days during each <span class="term">prytany</span>, but they did not happen on days when the <span class="term">law-courts</span> were in session (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.80</span>). They seem also to have been scheduled around other important events, such as religious <span class="term">festivals</span>. Aeschines is highly critical of an Assembly that was called on the 8th day of the month Elaphobolion, a day of sacrifices to Asclepius (the orator says that this was unprecedented in memory) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.67</span>), and Demosthenes criticizes a motion to have the Assembly meet on the 12th of the month Hecatombaion, a festival day for Cronus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.26</span>).</p>

<div class="p">In addition to Sovereign Assemblies (<span class="foreign">κυρίαι ἐκκλησίαι</span>) and Assemblies (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησίαι</span>), there were <span class="quote_inline">Called-together Assemblies</span> (<span class="foreign">σύγκλητοι ἐκκλησίαι</span>); the term appears only in literary evidence (not in inscriptions) during the 4th century, and its meaning is not entirely clear. Sometimes our sources seem to use it to refer to extra meetings, in addition to the normal four that happened in each <span class="term">prytany</span>. Aeschines mentions a time when Athens was in such a panic over Philip of Macedon’s war against Amphipolis, that <span class="quote_inline">there were more Called-together Assemblies (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησίας συγκλήτους</span>) than scheduled Assemblies (<span class="foreign">τὰς τεταγμένας</span>)</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.72</span>). But at other times the term seems to indicate an Assembly called at short notice, but not necessarily an extra Assembly. During a military crisis involving Philip, Demosthenes says that a regular Assembly met and disbanded, but that people continued to discuss matters in the Agora, thinking that another Assembly, a <span class="quote_inline">called-together Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">σύγκλητος ἐκκλησία</span>), might be called at any time (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.123</span>). One such Assembly was called on short notice when news came that a fleet under the command of Leodamas had been captured by Philip of Macedon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.73</span>); another was called, with the hurdles set out and the trumpeter summoned, upon news that Elatea was captured (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.169</span>). Other examples of Called-together Assemblies are at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.63</span>, where we find that the Assembly met on two subsequent days to discuss foreign policy issues (in this case, the first Assembly was devoted to discussion of the issues, and at the second there was only voting, without discussion [<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.65</span>]), and at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.68</span>, where Demosthenes calls for an Assembly to meet immediately and discuss a treaty with Philip. This last provides good evidence that the term <span class="foreign">συγκλήτος ἐκκλησία</span> referred mainly to an Assembly called on short notice, because an inscription shows us that at this very Assembly a certain amount of normal business was discussed before the pressing issues regarding Philip came up for a vote (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 212.53-57</span>). Furthermore, another inscription mentions a <span class="quote_inline">Called-together Sovereign Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησία κυρία συγκλήτος</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 359</span>), which must refer to a Sovereign Assembly called on short notice. </div>

<div class="p">It seems, too, that extra Assemblies were not called lightly. Demosthenes mentions an occasion on which the <span class="term">Council</span> chose to act on its own, because there was <span class="quote_inline">no remaining Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησία ὑπόλοιπος</span>) in that <span class="term">prytany</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.154</span>).

<div class="Section" id="Conduct"><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">The Conduct of Meetings</span></h2>

<p>Officials of the <span class="term">Council</span> called together a meeting of the Assembly, which opened with various religious rituals before the <span class="term">citizens</span> were invited to speak and vote on matters of public business.</p>

<div class="p"><span class="quote_inline">Those serving as <span class="term">Prytaneis</span></span> (<span class="foreign">οἱ πρυτανεύοντες</span>) (the same word, <span class="quote_inline">prytaneis</span> refers to the governmental ‘months’, ten each year, and to the members of the <span class="term">Council</span> who were presiding during a given <span class="term">‘prytany’</span>), normally called meetings of the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.3</span>), and posted the agenda beforehand (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.4</span>). In the case of the special Assembly for the ratification of laws, if the <span class="term">Prytaneis</span> failed to call for an Assembly on the assigned date, they were each to be fined 1000 drachmas (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.21</span>). If the Assembly was to vote on some matter by ballot, the <span class="term">Prytaneis</span> distribute the ballots (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.90</span>).</div>

<p>In the 5th century, the <span class="term">Prytaneis</span> actually managed the conduct of a meeting of the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.14</span>), but in Aristotle’s time (after the <span class="date">middle of the 4th century</span>), the President of the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐπιστάτης</span>) appointed nine Proedroi (<span class="foreign">προέδροι</span>) for each Assembly; these were chosen from members of the <span class="term">Council</span> who were not currently serving as <span class="term">Prytaneis</span> (<span class="foreign">οἱ πρυτανεύοντες</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.2</span>). These Proedroi managed the conduct of the Assembly; deciding when to put a question to the vote (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.84</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.68</span>), and deciding when to cut off discussion of a matter (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.67</span>).</p>

<p>The People did, on occasion, override the will of the officials conducting the meetings, as when, in the late 5th century, the <span class="term">Prytaneis</span> were unwilling to allow a vote, the <span class="term">People</span> overrode them with menacing shouts (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.14</span>).</p>

<p>The selection or appointment of Proedroi was potentially subject to corruption, which Aeschines hints at on two occasions (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.73</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.90</span>). In addition to these Proedroi, the Assembly elected a clerk (<span class="foreign">γραμματεύς</span>) to read documents aloud (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 54.5</span>); the orator Aeschines served as a clerk early in his career, although we do not know whether he was the clerk appointed to read in the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.79</span>).</p>

<div class="p">The opening of a meeting of the Assembly was marked by rituals. A sacrifice was made and carried around the area, and there was a prayer, both of these intended to purify the proceedings (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.23</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.158</span>; a parody of this prayer is found at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span>
 314</span>). The heralds (<span class="foreign">κῆρυξ</span>) offered the prayer (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.23</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>). If a joke in Aristophanes is to be trusted, libations played some part in these rituals as well (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Eccl.</span>
 140</span>). The herald also called down curses (<span class="foreign">καταρᾶται</span>) on anyone who would mislead the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.70</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.97</span>; there is a parody of this at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span>
 335</span>). After these rituals, the Herald asked <span class="quote_inline">Who wishes to speak</span> (<span class="foreign">τίς ἀγορεύειν βούλεται</span>), and the assembly was opened (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.191</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.26</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Ach.</span>
 46</span>; cf. a possible parody of this at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Eccl.</span> 130</span>).

<div class="Section" id="ChecksAndBalances"><h2><span class="headingNumber">9. </span><span class="head">Checks and Balances</span></h2>


<p>While any male <span class="term">citizen</span> was invited to speak in an Assembly and all male <span class="term">citizens</span> could vote, the topics for discussion and vote were limited by what amounted to a system of checks and balances between the Assembly and the <span class="term">Council</span>.</p>

<p>The Council could pass ‘Decrees of the Council’ (<span class="foreign">βουλῆς ψηφίσματα</span>) — as opposed to ‘Decrees of the Assembly’ (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησίας ψηφίσματα</span>), which the Assembly passed — but only regarding minor matters (for the terms for the two kinds of decrees, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.179</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.92</span>; for examples of Decrees of the Council, see the article on <span class="term">Council</span>). Important decrees were passed by the Assembly. The Assembly, too, could act on certain things without any intervention from the <span class="term">Council</span>, such as the business that regularly appeared on the agenda for the Sovereign Assembly in each <span class="term">prytany</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.4</span>), or the annual vote on the laws that took place in the first Assembly of the year (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>).</p>

<p>But in important matters, the <span class="term">Council</span> and the Assembly had to work together. The Assembly could not discuss or vote on a matter that the presiding officials, the <span class="term">Prytaneis</span>, did not put on the agenda, and the <span class="term">Prytaneis</span> could not put anything on the agenda unless the <span class="term">Council</span> had considered it first (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.5</span>). The <span class="term">Council</span> had to approve a <span class="term">probouleuma</span>, or resolution (<span class="foreign">προβούλευμα</span>), which was read at the Assembly, whereupon the <span class="term">citizens</span> could discuss it and vote on it (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.85</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.34</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Once the resolution came to the Assembly, it ceased to be a probouleuma and became a <span class="term">psephisma</span> (<span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span>), a <span class="quote_inline">thing to be voted on</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.234</span>). A very clear example of this process in action is <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.4</span>, where the orator mentions a probouleuma passed by the <span class="term">Council</span> asking the Assembly to discuss and vote on how to spend a budget surplus: should it go to military preparations or to public festivals?</div>

<div class="p">It seems that the <span class="term">Council</span> could send two different kinds of <span class="term">probouleumata</span> (the plural of <span class="titlem">probouleuma</span>) to the Assembly. Sometimes the <span class="term">Council</span> would pass an open-ended probouleuma to the Assembly, which would debate it and vote on it; the ensuing decree, when it was inscribed on stone, would then begin with the words <span class="quote_inline">It was decided by the <span class="term">People</span> that…</span> (<span class="foreign">ἔδοξε τῷ δήμῳ</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 240</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 337</span>). Because the <span class="term">Council</span> had not made a specific recommendation, the decree was credited to the will of the Athenian people. At other times, the <span class="term">Council</span> might send a decree with a specific recommendation, which the Assembly would simply vote on; in these cases, the ensuing decree would begin with the words <span class="quote_inline">It was decided by the <span class="term">Council</span> and the <span class="term">People</span> that#8230;</span> (<span class="foreign">ἔδοξε τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῷ δήμῳ</span>) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 206</span>). In this case, because the Assembly merely ratified the <span class="term">Council</span>’s decision, the decree was credit to the will of both.</div>

<p>Anyone who introduced a measure in the Assembly that had not been approved by the <span class="term">Council</span> was subject to prosecution for illegal procedure (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.5</span>); the <span class="term">Council</span> would try his case, but if he were found guilty before the <span class="term">Council</span>, he could appeal his case back to the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.2</span>).</p>

<div class="p">The relationship between the <span class="term">Council</span> and the Assembly seems to have been a complicated one. Demosthenes, for example, mentions a probouleuma being passed by the <span class="term">Council</span> <span class="quote_inline">in the hopes that it might be ratified by a deluded Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">ἵνα κυρώσειεν ὁ δῆμος ἐξαπατηθείς</span>), which suggests that some Athenians, at least, thought the Assembly to be more easily fooled than the <span class="term">Council</span>, although both were composed of a cross-section of <span class="term">citizens</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.18</span>). The rules governing probouleumata and psephismata also seem to have been somewhat ambiguous. One dispute over the interpretation of those rules focused on a law (<span class="foreign">νόμος</span>) that allowed the Assembly to give an award to the <span class="term">Council</span>, if the <span class="term">citizens</span> thought that the <span class="term">Council</span> had done a particularly good job; on this occasion, the <span class="term">Presiding Official</span> (<span class="foreign">πρόεδρος</span>) put a motion to the vote, and the Assembly approved it by a show of hands (<span class="foreign">χειροτονία</span>). The dispute, between Demosthenes and Androtion, was over the legality of this vote. Androtion claimed that because there was already a law allowing the Assembly to make such a vote, no probouleuma was necessary; but Demosthenes argued that the existence of the law merely allowed a probouleuma to be passed, and any vote by the Assembly without a probouleuma was illegal (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 22.5</span>). We do not know, unfortunately, how this particular dispute was resolved.
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Voting"><h2><span class="headingNumber">10. </span><span class="head">Voting</span></h2>

<p>Most voting in the Assembly was by a show of hands (<span class="foreign">χειροτονία</span>), although some votes were conducted by secret ballot (<span class="foreign">ψῆφος</span>). </p>

<div class="p">Aristotle says that payment for attendance was instituted specifically to <span class="quote_inline">get people to come to vote by show of hands</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.3</span>). Even the most serious of matters were often decided by show of hands, such as the <span class="term">impeachment</span> and condemnation of <span class="term">generals</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 34.1</span>) and the approval of formal laws (<span class="foreign">νόμοι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>) (laws were more significant than decrees; see below and on <span class="term">Legislation</span>). This method of voting limited the business of the Assembly to daylight hours, as this anecdote from Xenophon shows: <blockquote class="quote"><p>it was decided, however, that the matter should be postponed to another meeting of the Assembly (for by that time it was late in the day and they could not have distinguished the hands in the voting).</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ἔδοξε δὲ ἀναβαλέσθαι εἰς ἑτέραν ἐκκλησίαν, τότε γὰρ ὀψὲ ἦν καὶ τὰς χεῖρας οὐκ ἂν καθεώρων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.7</span>). Under certain circumstances, the Assembly would vote by ‘ballot’, literally <span class="quote_inline">pebble</span> (<span class="foreign">ψῆφος</span>); this was organized by Tribes (<span class="foreign">φυλαί</span>), with two urns, serving as ballot-boxes, for each Tribe (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.9</span>). Voting by ballot was limited to issues which had to be decided by a quorum of 6000 <span class="term">citizens</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.89</span> - <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.90</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Once the Assembly had approved something, the decree, its date, and the names of the officials who put the matter to the vote, were recorded and preserved as a public record of the proceedings of government (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.89</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.58</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.75</span>). Thus Aeschines could refer to a decree (<span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span>) <span class="quote_inline">as originally written</span> (<span class="foreign">ὡς ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐγράφη</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.66</span>). When Aeschines officially declined to serve as an ambassador when selected by the Assembly, his affidavit refusing that office was preserved with the original decree in the Metroon, the Temple of Demeter (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.129</span>).
</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="DecreesAndLaws"><h2><span class="headingNumber">11. </span><span class="head">Decrees and Laws</span></h2>

<p>The assembly passed ‘decrees’ (<span class="foreign">ψήφισματα</span>) by show of hands (<span class="foreign">χειροτονία</span>), but, in the 4th century at least, these decrees were not the same as ‘laws’ (<span class="foreign">νόμοι</span>). Laws were more permanent, more universal, and therefore harder to pass; for example, a quorum of 6000 <span class="term">citizens</span> was needed to vote on a law that named an individual (a <span class="foreign">νόμος ἐπ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἄνδρι</span>) — such a law revoking someone’s <span class="term">citizenship</span> — but decrees naming individuals required no special quorum (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.87</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.59</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Aeschines distinguishes between the two, once asking rhetorically why the laws are good, but the decrees of the Assembly are bad (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.177</span>). Aristotle makes a theoretical distinction between laws and decrees, noting that in some kinds of democracy the laws rule, but in other kinds decrees of an assembly can override laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1292a</span>). Athens was the former kind of democracy, according to Demosthenes, who quotes a principle of Athenian governance, that <span class="quote_inline">No decree, either of the <span class="term">Council</span> or the Assembly shall have more authority than a law</span> (<span class="foreign">ψήφισμα δὲ μηδὲν μήτε βουλῆς μήτε δήμου νόμου κυριώτερον εἶναι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.87</span>). On the other hand, the laws could determine what sorts of decrees the Assembly could pass, such as a law that allows the Assembly to pass a decree honoring a <span class="term">citizen</span>, but that limits the circumstances of such an honor (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.36</span>). Based on the laws, the <span class="term">courts</span> could disallow a decree (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.96</span>).</div>

<p>The Assembly was responsible for creating laws, but did not pass them or repeal them directly, as it did decrees. On the 11th day of the first <span class="term">prytany</span>, the Assembly met for ratifying the laws (<span class="foreign">ἐπιξηειροτονία νόμων</span>); the Assembly voted approval or disapproval, first, the laws having to do with the <span class="term">Council</span>, then laws having to do with the nine <span class="term">Archons</span>, and the laws having to do with other officials. If the votes expressed disapproval of any category of laws, then the last meeting of the <span class="term">prytany</span> was set aside for discussion of those laws (Demosthenes adds that there were severe penalties for any officials, <span class="term">prytaneis</span> or proedroi, who failed to follow this procedure) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span> - <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.22</span>). If, during those discussions, the Assembly decided that the laws needed to be changed, it could vote, on the third meeting after that decision, to appoint of Board of Legislators, a small committee of <span class="term">citizens</span> who would make the final decision regarding the laws; these were called <span class="term">Nomothetae</span> (<span class="foreign">νομοθέται</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.25</span>).</p>

<p>Only these <span class="term">Nomothetae</span> could repeal a law (<span class="foreign">νόμος</span>), but any Athenian <span class="term">citizen</span> could propose the repeal, as long as he suggested a law to replace the one being repealed (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>). Demosthenes himself was once charged with improperly suggested the emendation of a law governing the maintenance of warships (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.105</span>). Whoever wanted the <span class="term">Nomothetae</span> to repeal a law, or wanted them to enact a new law, had to write down his proposal and post it publicly near the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span>; the Assembly could then see the number of proposed changes and allot the <span class="term">Nomothetae</span> an appropriate amount of time for their work (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>). Whenever someone proposed that a law should be repealed, the Assembly appointed five <span class="term">citizens</span> to argue, before the <span class="term">Nomothetae</span>, in favor of keeping the existing law (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span>).</p>

<div class="p">In addition to considering and acting upon proposals for new laws and proposals that existing laws be changed, the <span class="term">Nomothetae</span> also undertook an annual review of all existing laws, looking for any contradictions (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.38</span>). If they found any contradictory laws, the <span class="term">Prytaneis</span> were to call an Assembly, which would vote on how to resolve the contradiction (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.39</span>). Demosthenes praises this practice of legislating (<span class="foreign">τοὺς νόμους τιθέναι</span>) as being open and democratic (<span class="foreign">παρ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ὑμῖν, ἐν τοῖς ὀμωμοκόσιν, παρ᾽ οἷσπερ καὶ τἄλλα κυροῦται</span>), and in helping the average <span class="term">citizen</span> keep track of the laws of the city: <blockquote class="quote"><p><span class="note" id="Note1"> [The <span class="term">Nomothetae</span> undertake their annual review]</span> so that there may be only one law dealing with each subject, and that the plain <span class="term">citizen</span> may not be puzzled by such contradictions and be at a disadvantage compared with those who are acquainted with the whole body of law, but that all may have the same ordinances before them, simple and clear to read and understand.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.93</span>).</div>

<p>Any new laws proposed by the <span class="term">Nomothetae</span> were to be published near the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span> and read aloud to the next meeting of the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.94</span>).

<div class="Section" id="Election"><h2><span class="headingNumber">12. </span><span class="head">Election of Officials</span></h2>

<p>A large responsibility of the Assembly was the election of public officials, both civil servants and military officers.</p>

<div class="p">Aristotle says that the Assembly elected <span class="term">generals</span> (<span class="foreign">ἀρχαιρεσίας στρατηγῶν</span>), officials with civic and military responsibilities, cavalry commanders (<span class="foreign">ἱππάρχων</span>), and other <span class="quote_inline">War Leaders</span> (<span class="foreign">τῶν πρὸς τὸν πόλεμον ἀρχῶν</span>), <span class="quote_inline">in whatever manner seemed good to the people</span> (<span class="foreign">καθ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ὅ τι ἂν τῷ δήμῳ δοκῇ</span>); these elections happened at a meeting of the Assembly held as soon as possible, weather permitting, after the 6th <span class="term">prytany</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.4</span>; also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 4.26</span>). The Assembly elected ten generals (<span class="foreign">στρατηγοί</span>), and voted on which general would assume which specific duty: one commanded heavy infantry on foreign expeditions; one took charge of the defense of Attica; one managed the military harbor at Munychia and one the harbor at <span class="quote_inline">the Point</span> (<span class="foreign">εἰς τὴν Ἀκτήν</span>); one managed the Symmories (<span class="foreign">συμμορίαι</span>), which were the groups of <span class="term">citizens</span>, called <span class="term">trierarchs</span> (<span class="foreign">τριήραρχοι</span>) responsible for maintaining warships; and others were dispatched wherever they were needed (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 61.1</span>). The Assembly also elected ten infantry commanders or taxiarchs (<span class="foreign">ταξιάρχαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 61.3</span>). Demosthenes mentions being, himself, elected taxiarch (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 40.34</span>). They elected two cavalry commanders, or hipparchs (<span class="foreign">ἵππαρχοι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 61.4</span>), and a special hipparch for the island of Lemnos (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 61.5</span>). The Assembly elected ten phylarchs (<span class="foreign">φύλαρχοι</span>), who each commanded the cavalry units contributed by one of Athens’ Tribes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 61.4</span>).</div>

<div class="p">In addition to these officials, the Assembly elected <span class="quote_inline">stewards</span> (<span class="foreign">ταμίας</span>) who were responsible for the ships Paralus and Ammon, which were used for special official functions (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 61.7</span>). The Assembly could dispatch these ships on missions and establish their budgets (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.173</span>). Naval architects (<span class="foreign">ἀρχιτέκτονας ἐπὶ τὰς ναῦς</span>) were also elected by the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 46.1</span>). On at least one occasion, Demosthenes proposed that the Assembly meet on a certain date to elect officials to oversee the maintenance of the city walls (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.27</span>). At one time, according to Aristotle, the Assembly also elected an official to manage the parade featuring a 30-oared ship that carried young people through the streets of the city during the Festival of the Dionysia (<span class="foreign">ἀρχιθέωρον τῷ τριακοντορίῳ τῷ τοὺς ᾐθέους ἄγοντι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 56.4</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The Assembly chose a Treasurer of Military Funds, the Controllers of the <span class="term">Theoric Fund</span>, and the Superintendent of Wells; all of these officials held office from one Panathaea (the ‘All Athens Festival’) to the next, four years (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.1</span>). The Assembly elected by show of hands ten sacrificial officers called <span class="quote_inline">Superintendents of Expiations</span> (<span class="foreign">τοὺς ἐπὶ τὰ ἐκθύματα</span>), responsible for making sacrifices to appease the gods (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 54.6</span>), and ten <span class="quote_inline">yearly Sacrificial Officers</span> (<span class="foreign">τοὺς κατ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἐνιαυτὸν</span>), who performed sacrifices and administered all the four-yearly <span class="term">festivals</span>, except the Panathenaea (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 54.7</span>). Demosthenes accuses a man named Meidias of demanding to be elected overseer of the <span class="term">festival</span> of the Dionysia, which might suggest that a certain amount of campaigning went on for these offices (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.15</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Aristotle says that the Assembly elected, by show of hands, a clerk to read document at meetings of the Assembly and of the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 54.5</span>); at one time a special <span class="quote_inline">Clerk of the Presidency</span> (<span class="foreign">γραμματέα τὸν κατὰ πρυτανείαν</span>) was also elected, but later came to be chosen by lot (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 54.3</span>). These clerks enjoyed free meals in the Tholos (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.249</span>).</div>

<p>Demosthenes mentions a law that no commissioner (<span class="foreign">σύνδικος</span>) elected by the people is permitted to serve more than once (<span class="foreign">μὴ ἐξεῖναι ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου χειροτονηθέντα πλεῖν ἢ ἅπαξ συνδικῆσαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.152</span>). But he also claims that the Assembly elected Meidias to the offices of steward (<span class="foreign">ταμίας</span>) of the Paralus, hipparch, and superintendent of the <span class="term">Mysteries</span>, sacrificer, and buyer of victims (<span class="foreign">μυστηρίων ἐπιμελητὴν καὶ ἱεροποιόν ποτε καὶ βοώνην</span>), which certainly suggests that there was no limit to the number of different offices a man could hold (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.171</span>).</p>

<p>Just as the Assembly could elect officials, it could also impeach them. See <span class="term">Impeachment</span>.

</div>

<div class="Section" id="EmbassiesOut"><h2><span class="headingNumber">13. </span><span class="head">Foreign Policy: Sending Embassies</span></h2>

<p>The Assembly was responsible for the general conduct of Athens’ public business, which included sending embassies to conduct business with other states.</p>

<div class="p">Aristotle, after listing the two special meetings of the Assembly in each <span class="term">prytany</span>, says that the remaining two meetings were reserved for <span class="quote_inline">all other business</span> (<span class="foreign">αἱ δὲ δύο περὶ τῶν ἄλλων...προξειροτονίας</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.6</span>). Included in that general category were matters of foreign policy, and especially the appointment and dispatch of embassies (<span class="foreign">πρέσβεις</span>, <span class="foreign">πρεσβευταί</span>) to other states. The sources contain many specific references to embassies sent out by the vote of the Assembly. Demosthenes mentions embassies sent by the Assembly to discuss peace with Philip of Macedon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.29</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.13</span>), one of three <span class="term">citizens</span> to Philip to discuss his capture of some Athenian grain ships (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.75</span>), an embassy to Philip asking him to make war on Persia, and a later embassy to the Persian King asking him to make war on Philip (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.75</span>). On one occasion we hear of a private individual, and not even an Athenian <span class="term">citizen</span>, asking the Athenian Assembly to dispatch an embassy: Phrynon of Rhamnus had been captured by pirates and subsequently ransomed, whereupon he asked the Athenian Assembly to appoint an embassy to go to Philip and get Philip to help get his ransom back (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.13</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Certain embassies were recurring, such as the Hieronomon (<span class="foreign">ἱερομνήμων</span>) and the Pylagoras (<span class="foreign">πυλάγορας</span>), who were ambassadors with specific religious duties; Aeschines mentions a decree that orders them to travel to Themopylae and Delphi <span class="quote_inline">at the times appointed by our fathers</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐν τοῖς τεταγμένοις χρόνοις ὑπὸ τῶν προγόνων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.127</span>).</div>

<p>The Assembly could appoint <span class="term">citizens</span> to serve on embassies, but a <span class="term">citizen</span> could excuse himself by swearing an oath (<span class="foreign">ἐχόμνυμι</span>), as Demosthenes claims to have done once (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.122</span>). Aeschines cites a law that says that an ambassador chosen by the Assembly can excuse himself only by swearing before the Assembly, not before the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.95</span>). Once an embassy was approved, the Assembly could also dispatch an Athenian warship to convey the ambassadors to their destination (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 53.5</span>). The Assembly would also give the ambassadors instructions as to how to conduct their business (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.6</span>). As evidence that the Athenians regarded their ambassadors as sacred and immune from interference, we have mention of an incident in which Megara arrested some Athenian ambassadors, whereupon the Assembly voted to exclude all Megarians from participation in the <span class="term">Mysteries</span> at Eleusis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 12.4</span>).</p>

<p>Once an embassy, dispatched by the Assembly, completed its mission, it was to report to the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.125</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.47</span>). These reports were important: Aeschines mentions a motion to hold a meeting of the Assembly on a sacred day, so that the Assembly could hear an embassy’s report as quickly as possible (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.67</span>). The Assembly could not make foreign policy decisions until they had heard from their returning ambassadors, and we hear of at least one occasion when the business of several cities, which were engaged in multi-lateral negotiations, came to a standstill until an Athenian embassy reported to the Athenian assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.60</span>). Demosthenes accuses an embassy, which he claims reported only to the <span class="term">Council</span>, of failing in its duty by not reporting immediately to the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.19</span>); and the responsibility went in both directions, since Aeschines suggests that a returning had a right to the opportunity to report to the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.121</span>). If the Assembly reacted favorably to the report, it could pass a vote of thanks to the ambassadors and treat them to a meal at public expense (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.53</span>). But not all reports were so well received, such as that of Epicrates, who was subject to <span class="term">impeachment</span> and condemned to death for mishandling an embassy (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.276</span>). There is also a parody of an embassy’s report in Aristophanes’ <span class="titlem">Acharnians</span>, during which a character complains that an embassy to Persia wasted the city’s money (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Ach.</span>
 60</span>); the jokes here may reflect a common topic of discussion in the Assembly when embassies reported their activities.

<div class="Section" id="EmbassiesIn"><h2><span class="headingNumber">14. </span><span class="head">Foreign Policy: Receiving Ambassadors</span></h2>

<p>When ambassadors from other states came to do business with Athens, they appeared before the Assembly.</p>

<p>Aeschines mentions an occasion on which Philocrates moved, in the Assembly, that Athens send out ten ambassadors to Philip for the purpose of inviting Philip to send his own ambassadors to Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.63</span>). Just as the Assembly could send out embassies and hear their reports when they returned, it could also receive embassies from foreign powers. Aeschines mentions a motion before the Assembly to receive ambassadors from Cersobleptes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.83</span>), and a decree granting safe passage to ambassadors from Philip (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.109</span>). Ambassadors from Philip and other states came before the Assembly to make their case (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 7.19</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.111</span>). Foreign ambassadors might mount the platform to be questioned before the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.72</span>). The Assembly might vote special honors for foreign ambassadors, such as a free dinner in the Prytaneum (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.234</span>) or choice seats for a play in the Theater of Dionysus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.111</span>).
</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="ForeignPolicy"><h2><span class="headingNumber">15. </span><span class="head">Foreign Policy: General Issues</span></h2>

<p>The Assembly directed most of Athens’ foreign policy, including making specific decisions regarding alliances and military strategy.</p>

<p>When the Assembly sent out ambassadors or received ambassadors from elsewhere, it was conducting foreign policy. So, on the motion of Demosthenes, the Assembly dispatched five <span class="term">citizens</span> as ambassadors to negotiate a treaty of peace between Athens and Philip of Macedon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.29</span>). But the Assembly’s powers over foreign policy extended far beyond the dispatch of embassies. When the embassy just mentioned returned to Athens, the Assembly had to decide how to respond to the diplomatic developments. We hear of two subsequent meetings. At one, the Assembly discussed formalizing a treaty of peace with Philip, and at the other, it discussed making an alliance with Philip (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.53</span>). When these diplomatic efforts resulted in a specific proposal, the Assembly voted to make the treaty official (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.82</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.109</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.14</span>).</p>

<p>There are other examples of the Assembly managing foreign policy. The Assembly voted to send Timotheus to help the Persian Ariobarzanes, who was leading a revolt against the Persian king (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 15.9</span>). The Assembly voted to exclude all Megarians from the celebration of the <span class="term">Mysteries</span> at Eleusis, after Megara had arrested some Athenian ambassadors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 12.4</span>). The Assembly received a petition from Thessaly, which was asking that Philip of Macedon be admitted into the Amphictyonic Council, which was a body, consisting of representatives from several cities, that governed the shrines of Apollo at Delphi (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.111</span>).</p>

<p>One significant disadvantage of conducting foreign policy in the Assembly, on the Pnyx, out in the open, was a complete lack of secrecy. When Athens voted to make peace with Philip of Macedon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.82</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.109</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.14</span>), the people of Phocis, who were at war with Philip, learned of this within four days, according to Demosthenes, because some Phocians were in Athens and overheard the proceedings on the Pnyx (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.53</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.59</span>).
</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Citizenship"><h2><span class="headingNumber">16. </span><span class="head">Conferring Rewards</span></h2>

<p>The Assembly could confer honorary Athenian <span class="term">citizenship</span> on non-Athenians, or could award someone with immunity from taxes (<span class="foreign">ἀτελεία</span>), and could honor <span class="term">citizens</span> with gold crowns (<span class="foreign">στέφανοι</span>).</p>

<p>To confer <span class="term">citizenship</span>, six thousand Athenians had to vote, by secret ballot (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.90</span>); once <span class="term">citizenship</span> had thus been voted on someone, only a court could withdraw it (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.91</span>). Among the people on whom the Assembly granted honorary <span class="term">citizenship</span> were Teres and Cersobleptes, rulers of Thrace (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 12.8</span>), Ariobarzanes (a Persian), Philiscus, and Charidemus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.141</span>), Timotheus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.84</span>), and once, after the Battle of Marathon, all male <span class="term">citizens</span> of Plataea (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.104</span>). Demosthenes says, in one speech, that Meno of Pharsalus and Perdiccas of Macedonia were granted <span class="term">citizenship</span> by the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.199</span> - <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.200</span>), but at another place he says, quite explicitly, that these two were not granted <span class="term">citizenship</span> but merely immunity from taxes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 13.23</span> - <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 13.24</span>).</p>

<p>It is important to note a passage in Demosthenes where he says that the Athenians considered honorary <span class="term">citizens</span> to be ‘real’ Athenians only when it was convenient. (<span class="foreign">πῶς ἐστὶ τοῦτ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἴσον ἢ δίκαιον, ὅταν μὲν ὑμῖν συμφέρῃ, πολέμιον εἶναι φάσκειν αὐτὸν τῆς πόλεως, ὅταν δ᾽ ἐμὲ συκοφαντεῖν βούλησθε, πολίτην ἀποδείκνυσθαι τὸν αὐτὸν ὑφ᾽ ὑμῶν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 12.9</span>), and that the honorary <span class="term">citizenship</span> that the Assembly granted to Teres and Cersobleptes of Thrace was not ‘real’ (<span class="foreign">οὔτ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??Ἀθηναίους ὄντας</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 12.8</span>).</p>

<div class="p">The Assembly could also confer lesser honors by passing a decree that named the honored parties <span class="quote_inline">friends of the state, benefactors, and immune from all taxes</span> (<span class="foreign">προξενίαν, εὐεργεσίαν, ἀτέλειαν ἁπάντων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.60</span>). Epicerdes, who saved the Athenians captured in Sicily, was granted such immunity (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.42</span>), as was the general Conon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.42</span>). The Assembly could also pass a more simple vote of thanks, as it did for Callias (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 12.6</span>).</div>

<p>One honor that the Assembly could bestow was a crown. The Assembly awarded crowns, by decree, as rewards for some service to Athens. So, Nausicles was crowned several times for spending his own money on a military expedition while he held the office of <span class="term">General</span> (<span class="foreign">στρατηγός</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.114</span>). Diotimus and Charidemus were crowned for donating shields to Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.115</span>). Neoptolemus was crowned for raising money toward certain public works (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.116</span>). Demosthenes himself claims to have been awarded a crown for overseeing the repair of some fortifications and for having been a good manager of the <span class="term">Theoric Fund</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.118</span>). A crown could be held out as an incentive, as on one occasion when we hear of the Assembly offering a crown to the first <span class="term">trierarch</span> to get his ship ready for sea (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 51.1</span>). The crowns awarded by the assembly became the property of the recipient and his family, as opposed to being hung in a temple and thus dedicated to the gods in the recipient’s name (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.46</span>). There is a great deal of evidence regarding this procedure because Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon for illegally moving that the Assembly bestow a crown on Demosthenes; both Aeschines’ speech for the prosecution and Demosthenes’ speech in defense of Ctesiphon survive (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.1</span>).</p>

<p>The details of crowning are not particularly clear, because Aeschines and Demosthenes, naturally, present two different versions. Aeschines quotes a law mandating that anyone crowned by the Assembly must receive the crown on the Pnyx (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.55</span>; compare <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.32</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.204</span>, where he seems to use the word Assembly [<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησία</span>] as a synonym for the Pnyx). Elsewhere he mentions this law from another direction, saying that any crowns awarded during a meeting of the Assembly must be awarded by the <span class="term">People</span> (<span class="foreign">δῆμος</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.42</span>). Demosthenes interprets the law differently, saying that when the Assembly bestows a crown, it may be conferred on the Pnyx, but may also be conferred somewhere else (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.120</span>). Demosthenes evidently had cited a law saying that the <span class="term">People</span> (<span class="foreign">δῆμος</span>) could vote to crown someone in the Theater of Dionysus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.36</span>). According to Aeschines, the problem with awarding crowns in the Theater of Dionysus was this: since non-Athenians might be present in the Theater, such an award conferred more widespread glory on the recipient than if the crown were given on the Pnyx, and this was not fair to those who received their crowns on the Pnyx (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.43</span>).
</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="ReligiousMatters"><h2><span class="headingNumber">17. </span><span class="head">Complaints about Religious Matters</span></h2>

<p>The Assembly also dealt with questions of religious ritual and accusations of impious behavior, particularly because the democracy sponsored public festivals, which were both civic events, to celebrate the glory of Athens, and religious events, to honor the gods.</p>

<p>There was a special meeting of the Assembly regularly held in the Theater of Dionysus after the festival of the <span class="term">City Dionysia</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.61</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.8</span>, which says that this was mandated by a law [<span class="foreign">νόμος</span>] and was to be held on the day after the <span class="term">Pandia</span>, the <span class="term">Festival</span> of All-Zeus). The purpose of this meeting was, at least in part, to deal publicly with any issues that arose during the <span class="term">Festival</span>. Demosthenes claims to have lodged complaints against Meidias for crimes he committed during the <span class="term">City Dionysia</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.1</span>), and Aeschines mentions that a vote of censure (<span class="foreign">καταχειροτονία</span>) was passed against Meidias in the Theater of Dionysus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.51</span>). Demosthenes mentions the Assembly condemning a man, the father of Chariclides. The son was an <span class="term">Archon</span>, and the father was serving as his Presiding Official (<span class="foreign">πάρεδρος</span>); the father expelled a man from the Theater of Dionysus, which was proper, since the man was in the wrong seat, but in doing so the father laid a hand on him. Thus he was deemed, by the Assembly, to have profaned the <span class="term">Festival</span> and was condemned (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.178</span>). Another man condemned for profaning the <span class="term">Festival</span> was Ctesicles, who was drunk during the procession and struck a man with a lash (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.180</span>). Demosthenes mentions a decree, moved by Evegorus, that no one creditor may seize any property from his debtors during the <span class="term">Festival</span>, and that if he does, a complaint may be lodged at the meeting of the Assembly immediately following the <span class="term">Festival</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.10</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Other cases of religious profanation came before the Assembly. The Assembly convicted Euandrus of profaning the <span class="term">Eleusinian Mysteries</span> because he had won a suit against Menippus and arrested him during the <span class="term">Mysteries</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.175</span>). And Aeschines claims to have prosecuted Demosthenes for guest-murder (<span class="foreign">ξενοκτόνος</span>), an offense against the gods, and to have convicted him <span class="quote_inline">in the presence of all Athenians</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐν ἅπασιν Ἀθηναίοις</span>), which strongly suggests that this took place at a meeting of the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.224</span>).
</div>

<div class="Section" id="FinancialMatters"><h2><span class="headingNumber">18. </span><span class="head">Financial Matters</span></h2>

<p>The Assembly made decisions in financial matters as well.</p>

<div class="p">A topic of discussion for at least some meetings of the Assembly was the <span class="quote_inline">dole</span> (<span class="foreign">τοῦ λαβεῖν</span>), and whether monies should be distributed generally to all <span class="term">citizens</span>, or only to those who provided some service (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 13.1</span>). Demosthenes complains, on one occasion that <span class="quote_inline">we have surrendered the Assembly to discussion of doles</span> (<span class="foreign">ὡς περὶ τοῦ λαβεῖν ἐκκλησίαν ἀπεδώκαμεν</span>), and we might suspect that this was a popular and controversial topic (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 13.3</span>). The Assembly voted on how to spend any surplus funds; on one occasion, after the <span class="term">Council</span> had passed a <span class="term">probouleuma</span> (the preliminary measure that put a piece of business on the Assembly’s agenda), the Assembly had to decide whether to spend surplus funds on military things or on funding public festivals (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.4</span>). This particular choice, defense or festivals, appears elsewhere, where the question is whether the Legislators (<span class="foreign">νομοθέται</span>) should repeal a law and allow the <span class="term">Theoric Fund</span> to be spent for military purposes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 3.10</span>). We know that the Assembly determined military budgets, as when Meidias was dispatched in a ship on a military mission and the Assembly set his budget at 12 talents (see <span class="term">Money</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.173</span>).</div>

<p>The Assembly was the forum for accusations of financial misdeeds and the body responsible for investigating them. <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.11</span> mentions a decree that established a special investigation into any public money that might be in the hands of private <span class="term">citizens</span>; this investigation brought its results to the <span class="term">Council</span>, which then asked the Assembly to vote for further investigations (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.11</span>). A man named Pamphilus, from the deme Acherdous denounced Hegesandrus and Timarchus before the Assembly, accusing them of having stolen 1000 drachmas from the Parthenon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.110</span>). Demosthenes reports a case in which someone was charged with defrauding the treasury, and the matter went before the <span class="term">Council</span>, the Assembly (which spent a whole day on the matter), and two different <span class="term">juries</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.9</span>). If someone were imprisoned because he owed money to the treasury, the Assembly could agree to let him remain free as long as someone else posted bond (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.79</span>). However, if someone lost his <span class="term">citizenship</span> because of an unpaid debt to a temple, the Assembly could not restore his <span class="term">citizenship</span> without 6000 votes in his favor (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.45</span>).
</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="MilitaryMatters"><h2><span class="headingNumber">19. </span><span class="head">Military Matters</span></h2>

<p>The Assembly passed decrees on military matters, beginning with votes to make preparations for war (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 14.14</span>). Since Athens relied on a <span class="term">citizen</span> militia to fight its wars (see, for example, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 3.4</span>), military decisions were of immediate and vital relevance to those <span class="term">citizens</span> as they gathered in the Assembly.</p>

<div class="p">Military questions and financial questions were often inseparable, as when Philip was besieging Heraeum and the Assembly voted to launch a fleet of forty ships and levy a special tax to pay for the expedition (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 3.4</span>). It was not unknown for a private <span class="term">citizen</span> to offer, during a meeting of the Assembly, a voluntary donation (<span class="foreign">ἐπίδοσις</span>) for a military expedition (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.161</span>). The military decisions in the hands of the Assembly were not limited to broad political matters; while the <span class="term">Council</span> decided, each year, whether to spend money on the construction of warships, it was the Assembly that decided what types of warships to build that year (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 46.1</span>). Demosthenes, in one speech, asks the Assembly to vote to raise an army (to fight Philip) consisting of 2000 men, of whom 500 were to be Athenians, of any suitable age, serving for a specified period, and other specific details (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 4.21</span>); this request shows the level of detail with which the Assembly involved itself in planning. Demosthenes goes beyond appropriations to strategy when he asks that the Assembly vote that this army should wage a <span class="quote_inline">war of continuous annoyance</span> against Philip (<span class="foreign">ἣ συνεχῶς πολεμήσει καὶ κακῶς ἐκεῖνον ποιήσει</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 4.19</span>).</div>

<p>In times of crisis, the Assembly was responsible for voting to mobilize, and the first step seems to have been a vote that the <span class="term">trierarchs</span> (<span class="foreign">τριήραρχαι</span>) get their ships ready for sea (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 50.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 50.6</span>). The Assembly could set incentives for speed in this matter, and hand down punishment for inefficiency; we hear of the Assembly awarding a crown for the first to get his ship ready, and at the same time decreeing that those who did not launch on time were subject to imprisonment (<span class="foreign">ὃς ἂν μὴ πρὸ τῆς ἕνης καὶ νέας ἐπὶ χῶμα τὴν ναῦν περιορμίσῃ, δῆσαι καὶ δικαστηρίῳ παραδοῦναι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 51.4</span>). Likewise, the Assembly could, at any time, replace one military commander with another, as when Autocles was relieved of command, and the Assembly dispatched Menon to replace him (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 50.12</span>; see also <span class="term">Impeachment</span>).
</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="OtherMatters"><h2><span class="headingNumber">20. </span><span class="head">Other Matters</span></h2>

<p>It is important to remember, in the face of all of these specific actions by the Assembly, that this body could pass a decree on almost anything, as long as the <span class="term">Council</span> presented a probouleuma (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 45.5</span>). In certain matters the Legislators (<span class="foreign">νομοθέται</span>) could bring special matters before the Assembly, such as <span class="term">impeachments</span>, audits of <span class="term">generals</span>, or prosecutions for improper legislation (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 59.1</span>). The <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, too, could bring matters before the Assembly, such as a report on the subject of private residences being built on the Pnyx (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.81</span>). And certain business seems to have happened in the presence of the Assembly, but without necessitating a vote or a decree, such as the <span class="term">Archons</span> assigning flute players to tragic choruses (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.13</span>). So when we hear of the Assembly approving a law (<span class="foreign">νόμος</span>) stating that if any one of the captains of the ferry-boats, which traveled between the mainland and the island of Salamis, should capsize his boat, he is to lose his job (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.159</span>), we should not necessarily assume that governance of the ferry-boats was an ongoing part of the Assembly’s agenda, only that this was an issue that seemed sufficiently important for the Assembly and the Legislators (<span class="foreign">νομοθέται</span>) to take it up on one occasion.
</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Corruption"><h2><span class="headingNumber">21. </span><span class="head">Disorderly Conduct, Corruption, and Manipulation</span></h2>

<div class="p">Meetings of the Assembly were not always orderly affairs. Orators seem to have resorted to theatrics from time to time, such as in the 5th century when Cleophon came forward, drunk, wearing armor, and threatening anyone who wished to make an arrangement with Sparta (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 34.1</span>). According to Aeschines, Demosthenes once threatened to drag away, by the hair, anyone who advocated peace with Philip (Aeschines explicitly compares this incident to Cleophon’s antics many years before) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.150</span>). Aeschines also mentions Timarchus throwing off his clothes and leaping around <span class="quote_inline">like a gymnast</span> to punctuate some point (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.26</span>). Aristotle blames the late 5th century politician Cleon for this sort of behavior, saying that he was the first to use <span class="quote_inline">unseemly shouting and coarse abuse on the platform</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματος ἀνέκραγε καὶ ἐλοιδορήσατο, καὶ περιζωσάμενος ἐδημηγόρησε</span>), and to hitch up his cloak (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 28.3</span>). In addition to the antics of speakers, the assembled crowd could get rowdy. Demosthenes laments that many <span class="term">citizens</span> would come to the Assembly for <span class="quote_inline">diversion</span> (<span class="foreign">παρέργως</span>) rather than for serious deliberation (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 17.13</span>). When Philocrates tried to speak in favor of an unpopular motion, according to Demosthenes, the assembly <span class="quote_inline">raised a clamor</span> and refused to listen to him, forcing him to step down (<span class="foreign">θορυβούντων ὑμῶν καὶ οὐκ ἐθελόντων ἀκούειν αὐτοῦ, καταβαίνων ἀπὸ τοῦ βήματος</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.111</span>).</div>

<p>There were laws against such behavior. Aeschines quotes a law that if anyone who spoke off subject, failed to speak on each proposition separately, spoke twice on the same subject on the same day, spoke abusively, interrupted, shouted disapproval, or laid hands on the Presiding Officials (<span class="foreign">πρόεδροι</span>), then that person could be fined up to 50 drachmas for each offence, and under certain circumstances, the Council could vote to fine him even more (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.35</span>). But, as the evidence suggests, this law was not uniformly or consistently enforced, a fact that Aeschines laments (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.2</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Misbehavior of a more serious kind was possible, as well, and was the subject of debate in the Assembly. Aeschines mentioned a decree, proposed by one Demophilus, that was to set certain punishments for attempts to bribe member of the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.86</span>). Aeschines accuses Demosthenes of bribing <span class="quote_inline">hirelings</span> (<span class="foreign">μισθοφόροι</span>) to attend meetings of the Assembly and vote a certain way (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.72</span>). And Aeschines elsewhere complains of corruption deeper than specific instances of bribery, claiming that the Presiding Officials (<span class="foreign">πρόεδροι</span>) are not chosen fairly, but by a corrupt process (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.3</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Short of bribery, but equally subject to accusations, complaints and condemnations by the orators, were efforts to manipulate the normal workings of the Assembly and the government generally. For example, Aeschines argues that Demosthenes proposed a decree sending ambassadors to Thermopylae and Delphi <span class="quote_inline">the times appointed by our fathers</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐν τοῖς τεταγμένοις χρόνοις ὑπὸ τῶν προγόνων</span>); this decree was a ruse, Aeschines claims, to prevent those ambassadors from being at Thermopylae for an important meeting of the Amphictyonic Council, the body that governed the sanctuaries at Delphi (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.127</span>). In another passage, Aeschines makes a complicated argument that Demosthenes manipulated the <span class="term">Council</span> into passing a certain probouleuma for consideration by the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.125</span>). And again, Aeschines criticizes Callias for delivering, as his own words, a speech that Demosthenes had written for him (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.95</span>). In his turn, Demosthenes claimed that a cabal was formed against him (<span class="foreign">συστάντων</span>), that set in motion all sorts of indictments, audits, and <span class="term">impeachment</span>s (<span class="foreign">γραφάς</span>, <span class="foreign">εὐθύνας</span>, <span class="foreign">εἰσαγγελίας</span>). Aeschines claims that <span class="term">impeachment</span> (<span class="foreign">εἰσαγγελία</span>) was often used when a prosecutor preferred to argue a case before the Assembly, thinking that it would not be successful if argued before a <span class="term">jury</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.4</span>).

<div class="Section" id="BadGovernment"><h2><span class="headingNumber">22. </span><span class="head">The Dangers of Bad Government</span></h2>

<div class="p">The Athenians themselves were well aware of the potential dangers of direct democracy as exercised by the Assembly, and the orators, particularly, mention them often. Demosthenes says, <blockquote class="quote"><p>A man can do no greater wrong than by telling lies to a popular assembly; for, where the political system is based upon speeches, how can it be safely administered if the speeches are false?</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.184</span>). He complains of partisanship and the dangers it poses to orderly process: <blockquote class="quote"><p>You conduct your politics by syndicates (<span class="foreign">συμμορίας</span>); each syndicate has an orator for chairman, with a <span class="term">general</span> under him, and three hundred to do the shouting.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 2.29</span>). He complains that the Assembly was given to hysteria, describing how, on one occasion, someone broke into the Parthenon and stole a few oars, and at the ensuing meeting of the Assembly <span class="quote_inline">all those coming forward to speak</span> (<span class="foreign">οἱ παριόντες ἅπαντες</span>) cried that the democracy was overthrown and all the laws were null and void (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 13.14</span>). Aeschines complains that actions by the Assembly could interfere with justice, noting an occasion on which a <span class="term">jury</span> acquitted someone of corruption, not based on the evidence, but on the fact that the Assembly, earlier, had awarded him a crown (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.10</span>). He also complains of the reverse, that lawsuits (or the threat thereof) could stand in the way of proper deliberation in the Assembly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.146</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The most famous example of the Assembly behaving rashly and inconsistently comes from Xenophon. He describes the case of the <span class="term">generals</span> at the battle of Arginousae in <span class="date">406 BCE</span>, who were accused of failing to rescue the survivors of the ships that had sunk in the battle (the account begins at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.6.24</span>). These men were put on trial for their lives, and when the <span class="term">Prytaneis</span> refused to put the matter to a vote in the Assembly, arguing that the proceedings were illegal (the generals should have been tried individually, not all at once), the Assembly overrode them, and the <span class="term">Prytaneis</span> gave in out of fear of the crowd (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.14</span> - <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.15</span>). The <span class="term">generals</span> were condemned to death and executed, but after it was too late, the Athenians had a change of heart, and the Assembly voted a complaint against <span class="quote_inline">those who had misled them</span> (<span class="foreign">οἵτινες τὸν δῆμον ἐξηπάτησαν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.35</span>).</div>

<p>The affair of the Arginousae generals was one of the darkest moments of the Athenian democracy, an over-reaction following the temporary oligarchic revolution of <span class="date">411 BCE</span>.</p>
