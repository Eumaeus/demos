    <p>Ancient Greek democracy has regularly attracted the attention of modern political scientists
     as part of the discussion of the theory and practice of democratic systems of government. By
     far the most important ancient text for this discussion is the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span> of Aristotle. Studying what Aristotle has to say about democracy in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span> is challenging for several reasons. First of all, his remarks on the subject are spread
     widely throughout this extended work. The challenge is further increased by the discursive
     character of Aristotle’s arguments in the
      <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span>, which for one thing mix discussions of theoretical principles for systems of
     government with observations about actual Greek states of Aristotle’s time (and before it). Finally, there is the strong
     possibility that the traditionally accepted order of the eight ‘Books’ or
     chapters of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span> is not the order in which Aristotle meant his
     arguments to be presented.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="Introduction"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Introduction</span></h2>
    
    <p>The goal of this article is to provide one possible aid for those wishing to meet this
     challenge. It therefore offers a series of topical headings under which selected passages
     relevant to the study of democracy in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span> are rearranged. That is, under each topic the passages are listed not in the order in
     which they occur in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span>, but are instead arranged in an order that attempts to suggest connections in thought
     between Aristotle’s various remarks on
     democracy. The passages are paraphrased rather than translated word for word, although the
     paraphrases of the shorter excerpts attempt to stay as close to the Greek wording as is
     practical. Since the paraphrased passages are meant to serve as jumping-off points for
     consideration of the full text of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span>, each passage has an active link to the full text of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span>. A <span class="term">glossary of Greek terms</span> and a
     very selective <span class="term">bibliography</span> of
     recommended print readings are also included.</p>
    <p>Since the approach adopted for this site rearranges the order of material on democracy from
     the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span>, it necessarily removes each passage from its context in order to suggest connections
     in thought that might not be easy to grasp when the text is read serially from beginning to
     end. This displacement of the passages suggests an interpretation of the connections in Aristotle’s thought on democracy in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span>. The potential danger of this method, of course, is that reading excerpted and
     paraphrased passages without considering their full context can be seriously misleading. It
     must be strongly emphasized, therefore, that reading the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span> thoroughly from beginning to end (and more than once!) is the only way to try to
     understand fully its complex and interwoven arguments. With this caution firmly in mind, users
     can consider the arrangement of excerpted passages as a guide to further study of Aristotle’s reflections on ancient Greek
     democracy.</p>

    <p>Every attempt has been made to be consistent in the translation of crucial Greek terms, such
     as <span class="foreign">polis</span>, but the flexibility of meaning of some of them makes
     absolute consistency impossible. The following translations are used as consistently as
     possible:</p>
    <p>‘Polity’ for <span class="foreign">
      politeia
     </span> when Aristotle uses the word in its particular
     sense to indicate rule by the many in what he defines as the <span class="foreign">straight</span> or correct system of government of this type. (By contrast, he refers to
     rule by the many in a diverging and thus ‘erroneous’ system as
      ‘democracy.’) (<a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?target=greek%2C1&amp;collection=Any&amp;lookup=politeia&amp;formentry=1&amp;template=&amp;.submit=Search&amp;searchText=plhqos&amp;alts=1&amp;extern=1&amp;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0045%3B2246%3B153318&amp;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0047%3B2395%3B58301&amp;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0049%3B2235%3B226496&amp;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3B2186%3B650314&amp;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0053%3B2241%3B455713&amp;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0055%3B2208%3B92661&amp;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0057%3B2221%3B580566&amp;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0059%3B2228%3B392364&amp;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0061%3B2115%3B14875&amp;group=collcat&amp;.cgifields=alts&amp;.cgifields=group&amp;.cgifields=extern&amp;.cgifields=type">See this word in selections from Aristotle</a>, courtesy of the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu">Perseus Digital Library</a>; <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?target=greek%2C1&amp;collection=Perseus%3Acollection%3AGreco-Roman&amp;lookup=politeia&amp;formentry=1&amp;template=&amp;.submit=Search&amp;searchText=&amp;alts=1&amp;extern=1&amp;group=collcat&amp;.cgifields=type&amp;.cgifields=alts&amp;.cgifields=group&amp;.cgifields=extern">see this word in all Perseus texts</a>.) </p>

     departure from convention is to avoid the potential ambiguity of the term
      ‘constitution,’ which as a familiar term in the United States today is usually taken to mean a formal, written
     document prescribing the structure of government. The ‘constitutions’ of
     ancient Greek city-states were often not written down, a tradition found today, for example, in
     the United Kingdom.)

      <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu">Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University</a>.
     Passages are cited, following the most precise standard form of reference to the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span>, as a four-digit number followed by the letter ‘a’ or
      ‘b’ (that is, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1253a</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1274b</span>, and so on) to indicate a particular section of the work. The precise location
     of the cited passage within a section is indicated by the line numbers that follow the citation
     of the section. (This reference system is derived from the Greek edition of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span> published by Immanuel Bekker in Berlin in <span class="date">1831</span>.) </p>

    <p>Each section (e.g., <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1253a</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1274b</span>,
     etc.) is presented as continuous text. The line numbers following the section designation are
     indicated in the on-line Greek text in multiples of five, while the corresponding line numbers
     in the accompanying English translation appear every twenty lines in brackets, but the line
     divisions as represented in your Web browser may not correspond exactly to this numeration. </p>
    <p>Since, for technical reasons, the links must go to the first line of a section and therefore
     usually not to the first line of the cited reference itself, the particular lines referred to
     may appear rather far down from the beginning of the section. In some cases, the particular
     lines may be far enough from the beginning of the section that they will not be on the screen
     when the section is first displayed, and it will then be necessary to scroll until they appear.
     Please be sure to note the precise line number within the section to which you are linking
     before following that link so that you can locate that line by scrolling. </p>

     <em>Introduction to the groups of excerpted passages</em>
    </p>
    <p>The first three groups of excerpted passages provide context for the remaining groups. The
     first of the three concerns elements of the definition of the ancient Greek city-state
      (<span class="foreign">
      polis
     </span>) in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span> because Aristotle’s discussion of
     democracy pertains to this type of political state. The next group concerns the definition of
     the citizen because it took citizens to constitute a system of government in the city-state, of
     which democracy was one. The third concerns the definition of different systems of government
     in the city-state, especially the notion that democracy is, in Aristotle’s view, a ‘diverging’ system of
     government. The remaining groups of passages concern democracy itself. In the paraphrases of
     the passages, square brackets [ ] indicate editorial additions to the ancient text. </p>
    <p>The text of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span> is conventionally divided into eight ‘Books,’ whose proper order is
     disputed. These book divisions do not appear in the continuous text to which the passages are
     linked. For those who wish to correlate the passages cited below to the book in which they
     appear, the following list indicates the division of sections in the books as traditionally
     numbered. Since the links go to the beginnings of sections, they will not go to the part of the
     section at which a particular book begins. For example, Book 4 begins at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1288b10</span>, but the link goes
     to the beginning of <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1288b</span>, from which point it is necessary to scroll forward to reach line 10. </p>

    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1253a</span>: 2-3: Human
     beings are, by nature, creatures who live in a city-state (<span class="foreign">
      polis
     </span>). [The same remark occurs at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1278b19</span>.] <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1274b</span>: 33-34: It is a disputed question what exactly the city-state is. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1279a</span>: 21: A city-state
     is a partnership of the free. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1255b</span>: 16-20: Rule in a
     city-state is the rule of those who are free and equal. This is not the same as mastery, where
     one is a <span class="term">slave</span> and the other is a ruler. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1276b</span>: 1-2: A
     city-state is a partnership of <span class="term">citizens</span> in a system of
     government. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1252a</span>: 1-7: Every
     city-state is a kind of partnership, and every partnership is created for the sake of something
     good. Political partnership, which is called the city-state, aims at the most authoritative
     good of all. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1275b</span>: 17-21: Given the
     definition of a <span class="term">citizen</span> in <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1275a</span>: 22-23, a city-state is
     a multitude of such persons large enough for self-sufficiency of life. </p>
    <div class="p"><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1252b</span>: 29-30: The
     city-state comes into being for the sake of living, but it exists for the sake of living
      <span class="quote_inline">well</span> (<span class="foreign">
      to
      eu
      zen
     </span>). [This phrase implies more than what is usually meant by ‘living
      well’ in English, which is to say ‘being prosperous.’ The Greek
     phrase implies above all a life lived in accordance with excellence (<span class="foreign">
      arete
     </span>). Living a prosperous life is not necessarily in conflict with this notion but is
     certainly not the principal implication of living ‘well’ in Greek. See the
     next passage.] </div>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1280b</span>: 29-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1281a8</span>: A city-state is
     clearly not just living together in a shared territory for mutual defense and the exchange of
     goods. It is rather a partnership among households, clans, and villages for living
      ‘well,’ for the sake of a fully developed and self-sufficient life. Those
     who contribute most to a partnership of this sort have a greater part in the city than those
     who are equal or greater in freedom or family, but unequal in political excellence, or those
     who outdo them in wealth, but are outdone in excellence. </p>
    <div class="p"><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1278b</span>: 21-25: The goal
     or purpose (<span class="foreign">
      telos
     </span>) of the city-state certainly encompasses physical existence and survival, but it is
     also more than that, namely, living <span class="quote_inline">finely</span> (<span class="foreign">
      to
      zen
      kalos
     </span>). </div>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1280b</span>: 6-8: The
     city-state that is truly a city-state must be concerned with excellence (<span class="foreign">
      arete
     </span>). </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1323b</span>: 30-34: The best
     city-state is happy and acts finely. It is impossible for those who do not do fine things to
     act finely. There is no fine action of man or city-state apart from excellence and thinking. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1253a</span>: 37: Justice is a
     thing of the city-state. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1282b</span>: 16-18: The
     political good is justice, and justice is the common advantage. </p>

   <div class="Section" id="PassagesCitizen"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">Passages: Defining the Citizen</span></h2>
    
    <p>
     <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1275a</span>: 22-23: A <span class="term">citizen</span> defined in simple terms is someone who can participate in
     judging [that is, serve as a <span class="term">juror</span> in the <span class="term">court system</span>] and in governing [that is, serve in public office,
     which here means not just <span class="term">magistracies</span> but also serving in the
      <span class="term">assembly</span> and on the <span class="term">council</span> in
     systems of government that have these institutions]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1275b</span>: 5-7: The
     definition of <span class="term">citizen</span> just given in <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1275a</span>: 22-23 applies
     especially to democracy and possibly, though not necessarily, to other systems of government
     because different definitions would apply in different systems. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1275a</span>: 2-5: Who is
     entitled to be a <span class="term">citizen</span>? No agreement exists; someone who would
     be a <span class="term">citizen</span> in a democracy would often not be a <span class="term">citizen</span> in an oligarchy. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1278a</span>: 8-25: In the
     best city-state, craftsmen (<span class="foreign">
      banausoi
     </span>) will not be allowed to be <span class="term">citizens</span>, since they are
     not really able to live freely, because they are not free from ‘necessary
      tasks’ [that is, they have to do physical work for a living] and therefore do not
     have the time to devote themselves to the activities in which excellence is manifested. This
     does not mean that they are poor; craftsmen in fact can be rich, but they still have to engage
     in making things with their own hands, [an activity seen as demeaning by <span class="term">citizens</span> in the social elite]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1278a</span>: 26-29: In many
     systems of government, <span class="term">citizens</span> are legally drawn from the
     ranks of foreigners [that is, both of their parents do not have to be <span class="term">citizens</span>]. In some democracies, citizens need only have a <span class="term">citizen</span> mother, and even illegitimate children (<span class="foreign">
      nothoi
     </span>) can be <span class="term">citizens</span> in many places. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1275b</span>: 35-37: Cleisthenes of Athens made <span class="term">citizens</span> of <span class="term">metics</span> [resident
     foreigners], who had been foreigners or <span class="term">slaves</span>, following the
     expulsion of the tyrants from Athens [near the end of the
      <span class="date">sixth century</span>]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1283b</span>: 42-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1284a4</span>: The <span class="term">citizen</span> in common parlance is the person who has a share in ruling
     and being ruled; in the best system of government [namely, a polity, on which see under ‘
      <span class="term">Defining Systems of Government</span>
     ’] a <span class="term">citizen</span> is both able and willing to rule and be
     ruled in accordance with a life lived with excellence as its aim. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1277a</span>: 26-27: The
     excellence of a <span class="term">citizen</span> consists of being able to rule and be
     ruled well. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1277b</span>: 13-18: The good
      <span class="term">citizen</span> must have ability and knowledge concerning both ruling
     free men and also being ruled. A good <span class="term">citizen</span> must possess
     moderation and prudence (<span class="foreign">
      sophrosyne
     </span>) and justice (<span class="foreign">
      dikaiosyne
     </span>) with respect to ruling. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1276b</span>: 28-29: The task
     of citizens is the preservation (<span class="foreign">
      soteria

    <p>
     <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1323a</span>: 14-16: To seek out
     what is the best system of government, it is first necessary to define what is the most
     desirable life. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1323b</span>: 1-4: Living
     happily, whether for human beings it comes from enjoyment or from excellence or from both,
     exists for those persons excessively adorned with character and purpose but moderate in the
     acquisition of external goods. </p>
    <div class="p"><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1295a</span>: 25-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1295b</span>: Like the best life, the
     best system of government is conducted in accordance with excellence. If excellence is the
     mean, as argued in the <span class="titlem">
      <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Nicomachean Ethics</span>
     </span> [for example, at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1101a</span>: 14-16], then a life and a system of government that is <span class="quote_inline">in the
      middle</span> is best. A city-state has three elements in its population: the rich, the poor,
     and those in the middle. The political partnership that is constituted from those in the middle
     is the best. </div>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1293a</span>: 35-42: In
     addition to the four systems of government that [other] people usually bring up in discussing
     systems of government (namely, monarchy, oligarchy, democracy, and aristocracy), there is a
     fifth one called polity (<span class="foreign">
      politeia
     </span>), which is also the term used to mean ‘system of government’ in
     general or in a generic sense. This fifth system of government is sometimes overlooked in
     discussions of the types of systems of government since it does not come into existence very
     often. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1289a</span>: 26-28: As was
     established previously in the first book of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">
      <span class="titlem">Politics</span>
     </span>, there are three ‘straight’ or ‘upright’ [and
     therefore correct and good] systems of government (<span class="foreign">
      orthai
      politeiai
     </span>): kingship, aristocracy, and polity. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1265b</span>: 26-28: The
     system of government called polity is midway between democracy and oligarchy. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1293b</span>: 33-37: Polity
     is, to put it simply, a mixture of oligarchy and democracy. The kinds of polities that tend
     towards democracy are customarily referred to by the name of polity, while those that tend
     towards oligarchy are called aristocracies. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1307a</span>: 15-16: The
     systems of government inclining more toward oligarchy are called aristocracies, while those
     inclining more toward the multitude (<span class="foreign">
      plethos
     </span>) [which can also mean ‘democracy’] are called polities. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1297b</span>: 22-25: As
     city-states increased in size and grew stronger in the heavy-infantry [<span class="foreign">
      hoplite
     </span>] section of the <span class="term">citizen</span> body, more men gained a share
     in the system of government. For this reason what are now called polities were previously
     called democracies. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1279a</span>: 37-39: When the
     multitude governs according to the common advantage, then this system of government is called
     by the term also used to designate systems of government in general, namely, polity. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1288a</span>: 12-15: The
     multitude suitable for a polity is one capable of military service that has the natural ability
     to rule and be ruled in accordance with law that distributes offices to wealthier citizens on
     the basis of merit. </p>
    <div class="p"><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1307a</span>: 5-8: Polities
     and aristocracies are undone by diverging from that which constitutes justice in the two
     different systems of government, [which is not necessarily the same thing in each system]. The
     starting point in a polity is when democracy and oligarchy have been not mixed appropriately
     [literally, <span class="quote_inline">finely</span>]. </div>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1275b</span>: 1-3: Diverging
     and erroneous systems of government are necessarily subsequent, not prior to correct [straight]
     systems. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1279b</span>: 4-10: There are
     three systems of government diverging from the three ‘straight’ systems:
     tyranny diverging from kingship, oligarchy diverging from aristocracy, and democracy diverging
     from polity. Each diverging system (<span class="foreign">
      parekbasis
     </span>) is structured to operate to the advantage of the ruler(s); for example, democracy
     is rule to the advantage of the poor. None of the diverging systems aims at the profit of every
     type of <span class="term">citizen</span> in common. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1289a</span>: 28-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1289b5</span>: Of these three
     diverging systems of government, tyranny is the worst (which is to say the furthest from
     polity), oligarchy the next worst, and democracy the most moderate. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1279a</span>: 17-21: While
     straight systems of government are concerned with the common advantage according to what is
     quite simply just, diverging forms of government are those that in error serve the interest of
     the ruler(s). Diverging forms of government tend to have an element of despotism, because a
     city-state is a partnership of the free. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1290a</span>: 13-29: Some
     people claim that, just as there are two main kinds of wind or of musical harmonies, and the
     other winds and harmonies are regarded as divergences from these, there are also two sorts of
     systems of government, rule by the people and oligarchy. On this view, the, polity diverges
     from democracy and aristocracy diverges from oligarchy. But it is better to postulate instead
     that there are ‘straight’ systems of government and systems of government
     diverging from them. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1259a</span>: 39-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1259b10</span>: The rule that a
      <span class="term">husband has over his wife</span>, a free person, is the same
     sort of rule that exists over free persons in a polity. Since the male is more fit to rule by
     nature, he will rule continuously in the household, unless he is somehow unnatural. In
     contrast, when citizens are equals and do not differ, then the roles of ruler and ruled will
     alternate. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1325b</span>: 7-8: For those
     who are alike, the fine and the just is [to rule and be ruled] in turn, for this is equal and
     alike. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1282b</span>: 10-13: Since
     laws align with the system of government, the laws of straight systems of government are
     necessarily just, but those of diverging systems are necessarily not just. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1309a</span>: 36-39: Justice
     and the excellence associated with it are not the same in different systems of government. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1309b</span>: 19-35: Diverging
     types of government fail to pay attention to the middle. Institutions suitable to a certain
     type of government can be the downfall of that type of government if they become too extreme.
     Just as a nose [on a statue] can still be appealing to look at if it diverges from the
     straightness that is beautiful but can become not even a nose if an artist pushes it too far in
     the direction of the extremes, so, too, a system of government such as democracy that diverges
     from the best system can still be adequate if it is not pushed to an extreme. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1287b</span>: 39-41: There is
     no such thing as a person being naturally fitted for any of the diverging systems of
     governments, for they have come into being contrary to nature (<span class="foreign">
      physis
     </span>). </p>

   <div class="Section" id="PassagesDemocracy"><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">Passages: Defining Democracy</span></h2>
    
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1294a</span>: 11: Freedom is
     the defining principle of democracy. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1317a</span>: 40-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1317b13</span>: The underlying
     principle of democracy is freedom, and it is customary to say that only in democracies do men
     have a share in freedom, for that is what every democracy makes its aim. There are two main
     aspects of freedom: 1) being ruled and ruling in turn, since everyone is equal according to
     number, not merit, and 2) to be able to live as one pleases. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1280a</span>: 7-11: Justice as
     understood in democracy is equality, but this considers only part of what is just; the same is
     true of the notion of justice in oligarchy. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1330b</span>: 19-20: A level
     location is suitable for a democratic city-state, an acropolis for an oligarchy or a monarchy. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1321a</span>: 5-14: A
     multitude (<span class="foreign">
      plethos
     </span>) has four divisions: farmers, craftsmen, merchants, and laborers. There are four
     [divisions of the population] useful for the military: those who own horses [cavalrymen],
     heavy-armed infantry [hoplites], light-armed infantry, and those who row warships in the navy.
     Light-armed infantry and rowers are wholly democratic [sections of the <span class="term">citizen</span> body]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1278b</span>: 8-12: The system
     of government of a city-state is the arrangement of its various institutions, especially those
     having authority. In a democracy, the people (<span class="foreign">
      demos
     </span>) have authority. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1281a</span>: 40-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1281b6</span>: That the multitude
      (<span class="foreign">
      plethos
     </span>) should have authority rather than those who are best and few in number [is a
     defensible position]. Even though none of the many is individually a man of excellence,
     nevertheless they can be better when they are all together, just as a dinner to which many
     people contribute can be better than one furnished from a single source. With each of the many
     having a part of excellence and intelligence, when they join together they become like a single
     person. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1286a</span>: 28-37: Any one
     man [of the many] may be inferior [to a man of excellence], but the city-state is made up of
     many men. Just as a meal done by many is better than a single and simple one, for this reason a
     mass (ochlos) can judge many things better than any one man. In addition, that which is many is
     less likely to be corrupted. So, although an individual’s judgment can be
     corrupted when he is overcome by anger or some other emotion, it is difficult for all to become
     angry and make erroneous judgments simultaneously. If all the men are good men and good
     citizens, they are less corruptible than one man. But the multitude must be free men and do
     nothing contrary to law, except in cases where the law necessarily falls short. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1281b</span>: 23-36: What
     authority should belong to the multitude (<span class="foreign">
      plethos
     </span>) of free <span class="term">citizens</span>, who are not rich and have not a
     single claim to excellence? They should not have a share in the highest offices because their
     injustice and imprudence would make this unsafe. States are unstable, however, that are filled
     with those who have no share of political power and are poor. Therefore, it is left for them to
     share in the deliberative and judicial functions of government [namely, the <span class="term">assembly</span> and the <span class="term">courts</span>]. For when
     they have all come together, their perception [of political issues] is sufficient, and when
     they are mixed with the ‘better’
     <span class="term">citizens</span>, they benefit city-states. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1282a</span>: 25-32: In some
     systems of government, authority is given to the people (<span class="foreign">
      demos
     </span>) over great matters, such as overseeing the audits of the conduct and accounts of
      <span class="term">magistrates</span> and choosing them, for this power is given to the
      <span class="term">assembly</span>. Thus, <span class="term">citizens</span> of
     whatever age and required to meet only a low financial requirement can participate in the <span class="term">assembly</span> and deliberate [on political issues] and serve in the <span class="term">courts</span>, while those meeting a high financial requirement serve as
     treasurers and generals [the chief civic <span class="term">magistrates</span>] and in the
     highest <span class="term">magistracies</span>. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1279b</span>: 18-19: Democracy
     is when those who do not own much property, but are poor, have authority in the system of
     government. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1279b</span>: 20-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1280a6</span>: The definitions of
     democracy and oligarchy according to whether the many or the few have authority in the system
     of government appear problematic if one supposes that it might happen that the majority in a
     state were wealthy or that the poor would be few in number but still have authority. In fact,
     it is only a contingent factor whether the few or the many have authority in a state. The real
     difference between democracy and oligarchy is between poverty and wealth. Wherever the rulers,
     whether they be a minority or a majority, owe their power to wealth, that is an oligarchy.
     Wherever the poor rule, that is a democracy. Usually, where the rulers hold power by wealth,
     they are few, but where the poor rule, they are many, because few men are rich but all are free
     [if they are citizens in a city-state], and wealth and freedom are the grounds on which the two
     groups lay claim to government. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1290a</span>: 30-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1290b2</span>: Democracy is not
     necessarily only wherever the multitude has authority. Oligarchy is not necessarily wherever a
     minority has power over the system of government. If the majority of a city-state were wealthy
     and had authority, nobody would call it a democracy, just as if a small group of poor men had
     control over a larger rich population, nobody would call it an oligarchy. Rather, democracy is
     when every free <span class="term">citizen</span> has authority and oligarchy is when the
     rich have it. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1290b</span>: 17-20: Democracy
     is when there is a majority of free, poor men who have authority to rule, while oligarchy is
     when it is in the hands of the wealthy and well-born, who are a minority. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1328b</span>: 32-33: In
     democracies, everyone has a share in everything. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1297b</span>: 37-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1298a33</span>: There are three
     parts to all systems of government for which a good law maker must try to find the best
     arrangement: deliberating about matters common to all, <span class="term">magistracies</span>, and the <span class="term">judicial system</span>. It is democracy
     when all the <span class="term">citizens</span> can deliberate about everything, for the
     people seek this kind of equality. There are different ways of doing this. One way is by taking
     turns rather than all together. Another is to have all citizens meet together but only for the
     election of <span class="term">magistrates</span>, <span class="term">law
      making</span>, declarations of war and peace, and audits of <span class="term">magistrates</span>, but to have all other matters decided by <span class="term">magistrates</span> chosen from the entire citizen body either by election or by lot. Another
     is just like this, except the <span class="term">magistrates</span> are chosen to the
     extent possible by election from those who are knowledgeable. A fourth way is when all citizens
     meet to deliberate on all matters, while the <span class="term">magistrates</span> render
     only preliminary decisions, not final ones. The so-called final type of democracy [on which see
     under ‘<span class="term">Types of
       Democrac</span>y’], the type of democracy that is analogous to dynastic oligarchy
     and tyrannical monarchy and exists now [in Aristotle’s time], is arranged in this fourth way. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1317b</span>: 17-41: The
     following arrangements are usually considered consistent with democracy:</p>
    <ul class="numbered"><li class="item">Election to all offices from among all the <span class="term">citizens</span>.</li><li class="item">Rule of all over each and of each over all in turn filling <span class="term">magistrates</span> by lot, or at least those not requiring knowledge and technical skill not
      having a financial requirement for holding <span class="term">magistracies</span>, or at
      least the smallest possible requirement.</li><li class="item">The same person not repeating the same <span class="term">magistracy</span>, or only
      rarely, except for military offices.</li><li class="item">Having the terms of <span class="term">magistracies</span> be short, wherever
      possible.</li><li class="item">Choosing <span class="term">jurors</span> from all <span class="term">citizens</span> to adjudicate all matters, or most matters, especially the most important
      ones.</li><li class="item">The <span class="term">assembly</span> having authority over all matters or the
      most important matters, while <span class="term">magistrates</span> have authority over
      none, or as few as possible.</li><li class="item">Providing pay for all service in government, or for all functions that exercise
      authority.</li><li class="item">Making no distinctions according to a <span class="term">citizen</span>’s birth, poverty, or occupation no public offices held for
      life.</li></ul>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1294b</span>: 3-4: Democracy
     allows men to participate in the <span class="term">assembly</span> with either no
     property qualification or a small one. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1297a</span>: 35-38: To
     promote democracy, one can use these legislative devices: providing payment for the poor for
     attending the <span class="term">assembly</span> and for <span class="term">jury</span>
     service and not levying fines on the rich for not participating. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1301a</span>: 11-12: The
     democratic way to arrange a <span class="term">judicial system</span> is to have all
      <span class="term">juries</span> drawn from all the <span class="term">citizens</span> and hear all cases. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1294a</span>: 39-40: In a
     democracy the poor receive pay for serving on <span class="term">juries</span> and the rich
     are not penalized for failing to serve. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1323a</span>: 6-9: Having a
      <span class="term">council</span> oversee the election to <span class="term">magistracies</span> that carry authority is democratic. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1300a</span>: 31-34: It is
     democratic for all <span class="term">citizens</span> to select <span class="term">magistrates</span> from all <span class="term">citizens</span> by election or by lot or
     by both methods. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1299b</span>: 24-27: In a
     democracy, <span class="term">magistracies</span> are filled from the ranks of the free,
     while in an oligarchy from the rich and in an aristocracy from the educated. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1294b</span>: 7-10: Democracy
     fills <span class="term">magistracies</span> by lot and does not require men to possess a
     minimum amount of wealth to be eligible to serve. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1273b</span>: 12-13: It is
     more democratic—indeed more ‘polity-like’—to have a
     larger number of people hold public office and not to have one person hold multiple <span class="term">magistracies</span> simultaneously, if the city-state is not small. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1287a</span>: 4-5: There can
     be an office of general (<span class="foreign">
      strategia
     </span>) without limit of time in all systems of government, even in a democracy. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1300a</span>: 6-7: It is not
     democratic, but aristocratic, to have a <span class="term">magistrate</span> to oversee
     children, or one to oversee women, or any other one to exercise this sort of oversight. For it
     is not possible [as practical matter] to prevent the wives of poor men from going out of their
     homes [because they have to work outside the home to earn money to help support their
     families]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1294b</span>: 19-39: Many try
     to talk about Sparta as a democracy because it has many
     democratic elements in the arrangement [of its system of government]. For example, the children
     of rich and poor are raised and educated in the same way. So, too, adults eat and dress the
     same way, whether rich or poor. As for their top two offices, one is elected by the people
     [that is, ordinary <span class="term">citizens</span>], and the people can be elected to
     the other. Others call Sparta an oligarchy because it has
     oligarchic elements also. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1271a</span>: 32-37: The
      Spartan common messes were intended to be a democratic
     institution, but they did not work out that way. Everyone is required to contribute [to the
     shared meals], but some of them are too poor to do so. The very poorest cannot easily share in
     the common messes, yet this is the ancestral defining principal of their system of government.
     Thus the very poor do not have a share in it. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1265b</span>: 35-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1266a2</span>: Some see democratic
     elements in the system of government at Sparta. Some of
     these think the board of overseers (<span class="foreign">
      ephors
     </span>) is democratic because it is drawn from all the <span class="term">citizens</span>. Others, however, call the board tyrannical and think the system of
     government is run democratically through the common messes and the rest of the everyday way of
     life at Sparta. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1270b</span>: 13-17: Since the
      Spartan board of overseers is too powerful, the kings must
     attempt to win their support. This has done additional injury to the system of government,
     which has changed from aristocracy to democracy. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1284a</span>: 3-37: A man who
     is clearly superior in excellence to all the rest of the city-state would be like a god among
     men. Democratic states instituted ostracism to banish such men for a fixed amount of time to
     prevent them from taking over the city-state because they were preeminent in their wealth,
     their large number of supporters, or some other source of political strength. </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="PassagesTypesOfDemocracy"><h2><span class="headingNumber">9. </span><span class="head">Passages: Types of Democracy</span></h2>
    
    <p>
     <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1289a</span>: 8-10: Multiple
     types of democracy happen to exist, despite some people saying there is only one type. [The
     same remark occurs at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1289a</span>: 22-25, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1291b</span>: 15-16, and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1316b</span>: 36.] </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1317a</span>: 22-33: There are
     two reasons why there are several different types of democracy: their majorities or
      ‘peoples’ are of different kinds (for example, farmers as opposed to
     craftsmen or laborers), and they can have different combinations of the institutions that make
     them democratic. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1289a</span>: 22-23: The same
     laws cannot be advantageous for every type of democracy. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1291b</span>: 30-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1292a13</span>: [This passage
     appears to list five types of democracy, but the next two passages list only four.]</p>
    <ul><li class="item">The first type of democracy is particularly based on equality, where neither the rich nor
      the poor has pre-eminent authority, but both are similar [in their authority]. Still, since
      the majority rules and the ‘people’ will be in the majority, this is a
      democracy.</li><li class="item">Another type is when <span class="term">citizens</span> have to meet a financial
      assessment to qualify for service in public offices, but the amount is low and any citizen
      possessing the required amount can have a share.</li><li class="item">Another type is when anyone whose <span class="term">citizenship</span> is not
      open to dispute [because they are descended from a family of <span class="term">citizens</span> whose <span class="term">citizenship</span> has never been
      questioned?] can have a share, and the law rules.</li><li class="item">Another type is when absolutely everyone, so long as they are <span class="term">citizens</span> [and even if they became citizens in a special way, such as being made <span class="term">citizens</span> in political revolution, and did not inherit their <span class="term">citizenship</span>], can have a share in public offices, and law
      rules.</li><li class="item">Another type is the same in the other ways [as in type no. 4?] but the multitude rules,
      not law. This happens when decrees [passed by the multitude] have authority rather than the
      law having authority. Here demagogues arise, and the multitude becomes a monarch.</li></ul>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1292b</span>: 22-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1293a12</span>: [There are only
     four types of democracy listed in this passage.]</p>
    <ul><li class="item">One type of democracy is when farmers and those possessing a moderate amount of property
      have authority. They govern themselves in accordance with law because their work leaves them
      little leisure time. They therefore meet in the <span class="term">assembly</span> only
      as absolutely necessary [to make decisions on matters not covered by the code of law]. A share
      [in the system of government] is open to anyone as soon as they meet the financial assessment
      set by law. They cannot be at leisure [for public service in governing] unless there is public
      revenue [to subsidize their participation].</li><li class="item">A second type is when anyone whose <span class="term">citizenship</span> is
      beyond question by his descent is entitled to have a share but only those with leisure [for
      public service in governing] actually have a share. The laws rule because there is no public
      revenue.</li><li class="item">A third type is when all who are free are entitled to a share in the system of
      government, but they do not in fact take part for the reason previously stated. Therefore, law
      necessarily rules.</li><li class="item">A fourth type is the last type to arise in cities. Since cities have become far larger
      than before and have public revenue from which to pay subsidies for public service, everyone
      is now able to participate. Even the poor have the leisure for public service thanks to the
      payments. Their private business and affairs are not an impediment for their public service,
      but such things are an impediment for the rich, who therefore frequently avoid service in the
       <span class="term">assembly</span> or the <span class="term">courts</span>. In this
      way the multitude of the poor wins authority over the system of government, not the
      laws.</li></ul>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1296b</span>: 24-31: Where the
     quantity of the multitude of the poor is so large as to overbalance the quality of the rich,
     according to the formula just explained [in the text preceding this passage], there democracy
     springs up naturally. What type of democracy it is will depend on what type of population is
     preeminent. For example, if it is a multitude of farmers, then it will be the first type of
     democracy it is the first kind. If it is a multitude of craftsmen and wage-earners, then it
     will be the final type, and so on with the types in between. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1318b</span>: 6-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1319a3</span>: There being four
     types of democracy, the best is the first in the arrangement previously mentioned [namely, in
      <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1292b22-1293</span>-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1293a12</span>, as listed above]. This type of democracy has a multitude that is mostly
     farmers or herders, whose work keeps them too busy to meet frequently in the assembly. They do
     not wish to serve in offices, where there is no great profit in it. Everyone will elect <span class="term">magistrates</span> and conduct audits of them and serve in the <span class="term">courts</span>, but those elected to office will meet financial assessments
     or, if there is no such requirement, will be capable people. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1319a</span>: 4-19: This is
     the best democracy because of what sort of people (<span class="foreign">
      demos
     </span>) it has. If one would like to institute a farming <span class="foreign">
      demos
     </span>, one should look to the law of the Aphyteans,
     who divide their little amount of land into very small plots so that everyone, even the poor,
     has enough land to meet the financial requirement for sharing in <span class="term">citizenship</span>. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1319a</span>: 20-38: Next best
     to having a multitude consisting of farmers is to have a herding people. The herding class have
     strong bodies and dispositions fit for military service. The other sorts of multitudes from
     which democracies are constituted are far worse. For craftsmen, merchants, and laborers lead
     lives devoid of excellence, and they are always in the marketplace and in the city and thus
     able to attend <span class="term">assemblies</span>. It is easier to create a good
     democracy in a place where the fields of the city-state are located at some distance from the
     city and the multitude must dwell out in the country [to work in the fields and are thus not
     easily able to come to the urban center to attend meetings]. Even where there is a crowd of
     merchants, <span class="term">assemblies</span> should not be held without the multitude
     from the country. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1319b</span>: 1-32: The final
     type of democracy, in which everyone is in the partnership, is not easy for every city to
     maintain, nor is it easy for this type to endure because its laws and its habits are not well
     composed. Demagogues expand its citizen body by allowing in those of illegitimate birth or born
     to only one citizen parent. If the rabble grow too numerous, they create disorder and can
     provoke the notable members of the population to resistance against the democracy. This type of
     democracy is made stronger by introducing institutions to mix everyone up together, as Cleisthenes did at Athens. This type
     of democracy promotes disorderly living, with a lack of control over women, children, and
     slaves, and a toleration for everyone living as he pleases, for the many prefer living like
     this to living with prudence and moderation. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1298b</span>: 13-19: The
     democracy today considered the most democratic—namely, the type in which the people
      (<span class="foreign">
      demos
     </span>) has authority even over the laws—arranges things to serve its own
     advantage in the deliberative body: they pay the poor to attend. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1305a</span>: 28-32: A change
     from ancestral democracy to the newest democracy can occur. If the people elect the <span class="term">magistrates</span> and there is no minimum financial requirement, then those
     eager for office act as demagogues to accomplish this and give the people authority over the
     laws. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1266b</span>: 21-24: The
     system of government at Leucas became excessively
     democratic when offices were no longer filled according to the established minimum property
     requirement based on ‘old allotments’ of land [but instead the requirement
     was lowered]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1312b</span>: 4-6: The final
     type of democracy is a tyranny. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1313b</span>: 32-41 The final
     form of democracy has characteristics of tyranny: women dominate in the household so that they
     can denounce their husbands, slaves lack discipline, and
     flatterers—demagogues—are held in honor. The people wish to be a monarch. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1295b</span>: 39-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1296a5</span>: It is best for
     citizens in a city-state to possess a moderate amount of wealth because where some have a lot
     and some have none the result is the ultimate democracy or unmixed oligarchy. Tyranny can
     result from both these extremes. It is much less likely to spring from moderate systems of
     government. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1311a</span>: 15-16: Taking
     after democracy, tyranny makes war on the notables in the <span class="term">citizen</span> body. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1276a</span>: 12-14: Some
     democracies, like tyrannies, rest on force and are not directed toward the common advantage. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1277b</span>: 1-3: In some
     places in the old days, before the development of ‘ultimate’ democracy,
     craftsmen were barred from office. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1312b</span>: 35-38: Ultimate
     democracy, like unmixed and final oligarchy, is really a tyranny divided [among a multitude of
     persons]. </p>

    <p>
     <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1286b</span>: 11-22: When there
     came to be many men alike in their excellence, they ceased to put up with kingship and instead,
     seeking something shared, established a polity. As they became [morally] worse and began to
     make a profit from common affairs [or ‘resources’], oligarchies arose, for
     they made wealth something honorable. Then these oligarchies changed first into tyrannies, and
     from tyrannies into democracies. For by always bringing power to ever fewer people in search of
     base profit, they made the multitude stronger, which attacked [the ruler(s)], and democracies
     arose. Now that city-states have become even larger than before, it is not very easy for any
     system of government but a democracy to come into existence. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1301a</span>: 28-31: [Rule by
     the] people developed because those who are equal in whatever way suppose that they are quite
     simply equal [in all ways]. Since they are all free in like manner, they think they are quite
     simply equal. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1292b</span>: 11-14: It
     happens that a system of government may not be democratic in terms of its laws but is still
     governed democratically on account of the habit and upbringing of the <span class="term">citizens</span>. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1296a</span>: 22-36: When
     there is factional strife between rich and poor because there is not a strong
      ‘middle’ [in the citizen body], the conflict leads to either democracy or
     oligarchy, depending on who wins. Once the fight is decided, the victors do not establish a
     shared or equal system of government; rather, they establish one to their own advantage. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1305a</span>: 37-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1305b11</span>: Mistreating the
     people can lead to the overthrow of oligarchy and the establishment of [the rule of] the
     people, as at Istros. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1303a</span>: 1-10: A system
     of government can be changed into a democracy when the size of the multitude of the poor
     increases, as occurred at Tarentum, Argos, and Athens. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1273b</span>: 35-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1274a15</span>: Some people say
     that Solon did away with an excessively unmixed oligarchy [at
      Athens] and ended the enslavement of the people (<span class="foreign">
      demos
     </span>), thus founding the ancestral democracy, which had a mixture of oligarchic,
     aristocratic, and democratic elements. In fact, what he did was to create [the rule of the]
     people by founding <span class="term">courts</span> whose <span class="term">juries</span> were drawn from the entire <span class="term">citizen</span> body. Later
     leaders continued [to increase the power of the people], leading to the present [more
     democratic] democracy. It really was not Solon’s
     intention for this to happen. But because the people were the source of Athenian naval strength
     in the wars against Persia, they began to have high
     aspirations [for political power] and to choose unworthy demagogues as leaders when socially
     more respectable citizens opposed this development. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1304a</span>: 17-34: Changes
     towards democracy (or another type of government) can come about when a <span class="term">magistracy</span> or some part of the city-state grows in power. This led to greater
     democracy at Athens after the war with Persia, when those who rowed in the fleet became the cause of the
     victory at Salamis and of the leadership [over its Greek
     allies] that Athens earned from its naval strength. So,
     too, at Syracuse, Chalcis, and Ambracia the people set up
     democracies after their participation in battle was the crucial element enabling their
     city-state to be victorious in war. </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="PassagesPreservingDemocracy"><h2><span class="headingNumber">11. </span><span class="head">Passages: Preserving Democracy</span></h2>
    
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1276b</span>: 28-29: The task
     of citizens is the preservation (<span class="foreign">
      soteria
     </span>) of the partnership that is their system of government. [Also under ‘
      <span class="term">Defining the Citizen</span>
     ’] </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1309b</span>: 35-37: The
     lawmaker and the political man must know what kind of democratic institutions preserve and what
     kinds destroy democracy. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1308a</span>: 11-16: The
     equality that supporters of democracy seek is just and advantageous for people who are alike.
     Where there are many people in government, legal rules of a democratic cast are advantageous,
     such as limiting term in office to six months so that everyone who is alike can have a share in
     filling public posts. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1321a</span>: 1-2: Democracies
     are generally preserved by having a large <span class="term">citizen</span> body. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1326b</span>: 2-7: A
     city-state must be populous enough to be self-sufficient, but too large a state cannot be a
     city-state because it is not easy to have a system of government in it. It is too large to be
     effectively managed militarily, and no herald can shout loud enough [to conduct the <span class="term">assembly</span> meetings of a large population]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1296a</span>: 13-16:
     Democracies are more secure than oligarchies and more enduring since they have more
      ‘middle’ people with a greater share in [political] prerogatives. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1309b</span>: 37-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1310a6</span>: To endure, a
     democracy, like an oligarchy, needs both the rich and the poor. A democracy that destroys the
     well-off becomes unstable. Where the people have authority over the laws, demagogues tear the
     city in two by fighting with the rich. Instead, they should do the opposite and appear to speak
     on the behalf of the rich. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1309a</span>: 1-9: It is
     democratic for all to be eligible to hold public office. The policy of not allowing office
     holders to profit from their office will mean that the poor will not desire to hold office, but
     rather they will prefer to tend to their own affairs. Thus, they will become more prosperous by
     working, while the notable and wealthy members of the citizen body will hold office because
     they have no need to earn money from public service. In this way the notables will not be
     governed by just anyone. Both groups will then have what they want [and therefore the state
     will be stable]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1299b</span>: 32-34: A <span class="term">council</span> (<span class="foreign">
      boule
     </span>) with a large number of members is supportive of democracy because it does
     preliminary deliberation for the people so that they can have time for their occupations. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1309a</span>: 27-31: In
     democracy, as in oligarchy, it is advantageous to give equality or precedence in all aspects of
     the government except the highest offices to that group which has the least share in the system
     of government. In a democracy, that group would be the rich. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1319b</span>: 33-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1320b17</span>: To preserve a
     democracy, one should strive not for measures that will make it absolutely as democratic as
     possible but rather that will preserve it for the longest time. The following measures are
     recommended: any confiscations of property imposed as punishment in a legal judgment should
     become property of the gods, not of the public, to prevent corrupt court judgments meant to
     secure a distribution to the population from the confiscated property; large penalties should
     be imposed for frivolous prosecutions to prevent harassment of the rich; if there are no
     [additional] sources of public revenues besides taxes [on individuals], confiscations, and
     corrupt court judgments to pay subsidies to the multitude for attending the <span class="term">assembly</span>, then only infrequent <span class="term">assembly</span> meetings and brief <span class="term">court</span> sessions should be held
     [to minimize the need to take money from the rich to pay the subsidies]; if there are
     [additional] public revenues, no surplus from them should be distributed to the poor, for this
     practice stimulates more demand for this sort of distribution; at the same time, the multitude
     should be kept from becoming overly poor, since this development creates wretched [and thus
     excess] democracy; money should be provided from public revenues to the poor so that they can
     acquire land for farming or learn a craft and become better off over time; the rich should be
     taxed to provide pay [to ordinary <span class="term">citizens</span> to enable them to
     attend] necessary meetings, but the rich should be released from unnecessary public service;
     the rich should divide the poor <span class="term">citizens</span> among themselves and
     then give them enough money [for necessary tools, etc.] so that they can start to work; <span class="term">magistracies</span> should be chosen some by election and some by lot. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1309a</span>: 14-20: In
     democracies, the rich should be spared and not have their property or their incomes redivided
     [for distribution to the poor]. They should also be prohibited from spending money on expensive
     but useless sponsorships of public occasions (<span class="foreign">
      liturgies
     </span>) such as leading choral groups for musical and dramatic festivals or officiating at
     torch races, even if they want to pay for such sponsorships. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1308b</span>: 10-19: In all
     systems of government no one is allowed to become overly great [so as to threaten the stability
     of the state]. Acquiring great prerogatives quickly tends to corrupt people, for not everyone
     can stand good fortune. Above all, the laws should prevent anyone from becoming especially
     preeminent in the power derived from his supporters or his wealth; if the laws cannot prevent
     this, then such persons should be sent to spend time abroad. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1308b</span>: 31-33: It is of
     the greatest importance in all systems of government to have laws and the rest of governmental
     administration so arranged that <span class="term">magistrates</span> cannot profit
     financially from their offices. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1310a</span>: 12-36: The
     greatest thing of everything that has been mentioned for preserving a system of government,
     although this is the thing everyone slights, is providing education in accordance with the
     system of government. For even the most beneficial and widely approved laws bring no benefit if
     they are not going to be inculcated through education and the habits of the <span class="term">citizens</span>. Education appropriate for a democratic system of
     government is not to be guided by what brings enjoyment to the partisans of democracy but
     rather by what makes it possible to run a system of government democratically. In the
     democracies that seem to be the most democratic, they do what is not advantageous because they
     define freedom badly. For democracy is thought to be defined by two things: by the majority
     having authority and by freedom. Justice is then thought of as equality, and equality as that
     whatever the multitude decides is what is authoritative. Freedom and equality are doing
     whatever one wishes. So in this sort of democracy everybody lives as he wants and for whatever
     goal he craves. This is a contemptible thing. Living according to one’s
     system of government should not be thought of as slavery, but rather as preservation. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1337a</span>: 11-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1337b3</span>: Everyone would agree
     that law makers should make the education of the young a special priority. City-states that
     fail to do this injure their systems of government. The education must suit the system of
     government, for this preserves it. Since a city-state has a single goal (<span class="foreign">
      telos
     </span>), education must, of necessity, be the same and be given to everyone. Its oversight
     should be a public matter, not as it is now, with everyone overseeing his own
     children’s education privately and having them taught what he believes best.
     Training for things that are shared should be a shared activity done in common. The Spartans might well deserve praise on this score, since they, more
     than anyone, devote effort to their children, and as a shared task. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1260b</span>: 15-20: It is
     necessary to educate women and children with an eye to the system of government, if the state
     is to be worthy. For women make up half of the free population, and from the children will come
     the partners in the system of government. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1342b</span>: 34: There are
     three defining principles for education: the middle, the possible, and the appropriate. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1266b</span>: 29-31: There is
     a greater need to level people’s desires rather than their property (by <span class="term">legislation</span> redividing property holdings or limiting them), and
     this can be done only when people are sufficiently educated by the laws. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1313a</span>: 41-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1313b6</span>: Education, debate,
     and social groups dedicated to inquiry and discussion are enemies of tyranny, since they
     encourage intelligent thought and trust [among citizens]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1263b</span>: 36-37: Since a
     city-state is a multitude, it is necessary to use education to make it into a partnership and a
     unity. </p>

   <div class="Section" id="PassagesDestroyingDemocracy"><h2><span class="headingNumber">12. </span><span class="head">Passages: Destroying Democracy</span></h2>
    
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1304b</span>: 20-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1305a7</span>: The main cause of the
     overthrow of democracies is the outrageous behavior of demagogues. By attacking [rich] property
     owners they motivate them to band together out of fear, and they also spur on the people [to
     try to bleed the rich]. In this way democracy has been overthrown at numerous places:
      Cos, Rhodes, Heracleia, Megara, Cyme. This is more or less the way democracies are destroyed. To win
     popular support, demagogues propose unjust treatment for the notables and thus force them to
     band together, by making them give up their property for redivision, or by having them expend
     their resources on public service, or by slandering them to force confiscations of their
     property. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1311a</span>: 22-26: The same
     beginnings lead to the overthrow of polities and monarchies alike. For those who are ruled
     attack monarchies on account of injustice, fear, and contempt. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1301b</span>: 26-29: Factional
     conflict (<span class="foreign">
      stasis
     </span>) erupts everywhere on account of inequality, or at least it does if no proportion
     exists between those who are unequal. In general, people engage in factional conflict seeking
     equality. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1303b</span>: 6-7: In
     democracies, the notables cause factional conflict because they have [only] an equal share in
     things even though [in their own eyes] they are not equal [to everybody else but feel superior
     and therefore feel they should possess more political power, etc. than those whom they see as
     their inferiors]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1302a</span>: 31-34: Factional
     conflict is the result of fighting to gain profit and honor and to avoid their opposites,
     dishonor and penalties. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1302b</span>: 21-24: Fear
     causes factional conflict, both when men fear punishment for injustice they have committed and
     also when they fear being treated unjustly. At Rhodes, for
     example, the notables rebelled against the people on account of legal prosecutions that were
     being brought against them. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1302b</span>: 27-33: Factional
     conflict occurs in democracies when the rich feel contempt for the disorder and anarchy [of the
     government], as at Thebes and Megara following defeats in battle and on Rhodes preceding the rebellion [of the notables]. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1302b</span>: 15-18: Factional
     conflict can arise when there is a person or a group whose power exceeds that of the city-state
     or its government. The institution of <span class="term">ostracism</span> came into
     being to prevent this. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1308b</span>: 20-22: Since
     men’s private lives can lead them to seek the overthrow of the system of
     government, a <span class="term">magistracy</span> is needed to oversee those living
     against the common advantage of the city-state, for example, in a democracy those living lives
     disadvantageous for democracy. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1303b</span>: 7-12:
     City-states sometimes fall into factions on account of their topography. At Athens, for example, the <span class="term">citizens</span>
     ones living in the Piraeus [the harbor district] are more
     democratic than those in the urban center. </p>
    <p><span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1302a</span>: 8-13: Democracy
     is more stable and less prone to factional conflict than oligarchy. In an oligarchy there are
     two types of possible conflict, namely, conflict between the oligarchs themselves and conflict
     between the oligarchs and the people. In a democracy, however, there is only conflict between
     citizens favoring democracy and <span class="term">citizens</span> favoring oligarchy, as
     no serious factional conflict arises in the people [that is, those favoring democracy] against
     themselves. </p>
