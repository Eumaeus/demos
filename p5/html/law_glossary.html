 <div class="Summary" id="summary"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Summary</span></h2>
 
 <p>This glossary consists of excerpts from <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">S.C. Todd,
 ‘Glossary,’ in P.A. Cartledge <span class="term">et al.</span>, <span class="titlem">Nomos:
 Essays Athenian law, politics and society</span> (Cambridge, 1990)</span>, selected
 by Michael de Brauw (University of Texas at Austin). Todd’s complete glossary
 (with some changes) also appears in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">The Shape of Athenian
 Law</span> (Oxford, 1993)</span>. This excerpted selection was first published
 electronically as part of the online discussion series ‘Athenian Law in its
 Democratic Context,’ organized by Adriaan Lanni and sponsored by Harvard
 University’s <a class="link_ref" href="http://chs.harvard.edu">Center for Hellenic
 Studies</a>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="agoranomos"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">agoranomos</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>agoranomos</em>, <span class="term">agoranomoi</span> · Lit. ‘agora-regulator(s)’: public officials attested
 in a large number of Greek <span class="term">poleis</span>; their duties consisted of supervising the
 commercial aspects of the agora.</p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ἀγορανόμος, ἀγορανόμοι</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="aidesis"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">aidesis</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>aidesis</em> · Because homicide in Athenian law was a matter for private
 prosecution, the relatives of the dead man, as prosecutors, were under certain
 circumstances permitted or expected to grant pardon (<span class="term">aidesis</span>) to his killer.
 Once this had been done, the killer was immune from further prosecution. (The derivation
 of the term is unclear: it is certainly connected with the verb <span class="term">aideomai</span>
 ‘to feel shame, awe or respect;’
 <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">LSJ</span> notes that the verb can be used to mean ‘to
 respect another’s misfortune’ and thus ‘to be reconciled to
 him;’ but unlike English ‘reconciliation,’
 <span class="term">aidesis</span> is only used to denote the action of the wronged party.) </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">αἴδεσις</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="anakrisis"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">anakrisis</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>anakrisis</em> · A preliminary hearing before the public official within
 whose court a case will later be heard (for the role of the presiding official within a
 lawcourt, see sv. <span class="term">arkhon</span>). Lit.,
 ‘examination,’ but it should not be equated with the inquisitorial
 instruction of civil-law systems: an Athenian public official had very restricted
 discretion; and unlike an arbitrator (see sv. <span class="term">diaitetes</span>), his function was not to settle the case. </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ἀνάκρισις</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="antidosis"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">antidosis</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>antidosis</em> · Lit. ‘a giving in exchange.’ A man
 who was nominated to perform a liturgy could avoid this duty if he could name another
 citizen who was richer and better qualified to perform the task. If the man challenged
 agreed that he was richer, he had to take over the liturgy; if he claimed to be poorer,
 then the challenger could insist on an exchange of all their property to test the
 claim—in which case the challenger would himself perform the liturgy as the new
 owner of the (putatively) greater estate. This process of exchange was called
 <span class="term">antidosis</span>. The advantage of the system from the viewpoint of the democracy
 was that it encouraged the rich to be suspicious of each other, instead of being hostile
 towards the state; but although we know of several challenges, there is no attested case
 in which the exchange was completed. </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ἀντίδοσις</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="apagoge"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">apagoge</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>apagoge</em>, pl. <span class="term">apagogai</span> · Lit. ‘dragging
 away,’ i.e., to the appropriate magistrate. Summary arrest was permitted
 against certain categories of criminal, such as thieves and highwaymen, if they were
 caught <span class="term">ep’ autophori</span>—red handed. If the accused admitted
 his guilt before the magistrate he was promptly executed; only if he claimed to be
 innocent was he put on trial. See also sv. <span class="term">ephegesis</span>.</p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ἀπαγωγή</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="apographe"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">apographe</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>apographe</em> · Lit. ‘a (written) list’: a catalogue
 of some or all of the property of a man in debt to the state. The state took no initiative
 in the confiscation of property: this was left either to private individuals or else, it
 appears, to local deme’s officials. The term <span class="term">apographe</span> is used to
 describe the list itself, the process of denunciation, and any judicial hearing arising
 out of the case. See also sv. <span class="term">phasis</span>. </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ἀπογραφή</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="apophasis"><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">apophasis</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>apophasis</em> · Lit. ‘a showing forth, declaration.’
 A procedure newly instituted around the middle of the <span class="date">fourth
 century</span>: either on the invitation of the <span class="term">ekklesia</span>
 or on its own initiative, the <span class="term">Areiopagos</span> could
 investigate any matter involving public security and present a report
 (<span class="term">apophasis</span>) to the <span class="term">ekklesia</span>, recommending
 particular action, for instance the prosecution of a named individual. (<span class="term">Apophasis is the subject of a Demos article</span>.) </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ἀπόφασις</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="apragmon"><h2><span class="headingNumber">9. </span><span class="head">apragmon</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>apragmon</em>, pl. <span class="term">apragmones</span> (adj.); <span class="term">apragmosune</span>
 (abstract noun) · Lit. ‘one who does not conduct business’: a
 person who refrains from taking part in public affairs. It can be either a positive or a
 negative characteristic, depending on the attitude of the speaker (‘philosophical
 contemplation’ or ‘political irresponsibility’). For the
 opposite characteristic, see sv. <span class="term">polupragmon</span>.</p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ἀπράγμων, ἀπράγμονες; ἀπραγμοσύνη</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="areiopagos"><h2><span class="headingNumber">10. </span><span class="head">Areiopagos</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>
 <span class="term">Areiopagos</span>
 </em> · The ancient and originally aristocratic council of Athens; its membership comprised those who had completed a term
 as one of the nine <span class="term">archons</span>. Its powers had been severely
 restricted by the democratic reforms of Ephialtes in the <span class="date">460s BCE</span>, which left it as little more than the main
 court for cases of homicide; in the <span class="date">fourth century</span>
 however other powers were added, most notably <span class="term">apophasis</span>.</p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">Ἄρειος πάγος; Ἄρεος πάγος</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="arkhon"><h2><span class="headingNumber">11. </span><span class="head">arkhon</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>arkhon</em>, pl. <span class="term">arkhontes</span> (participle acting as a noun), Eng. <span class="term">archon</span> or arkhon · Lit. ‘one who is in
 authority.’ Used in three senses: loosely, to refer to any Athenian public
 official; more strictly (usually a collective plural) to describe the ‘
 <span class="term">nine arkhons</span>
 ’; specifically, as the title of the senior of the <span class="term">nine
 arkhonships</span>. These were still the titular chief magistrates of Athens, but their real authority had been severely restricted
 ever since they began to be appointed by lot, apparently in the <span class="date">480s</span>. They retained however an honorific position, particularly in the
 administration of justice: or instance, former <span class="term">arkhons</span>
 became members of the <span class="term">Areiopagos</span> for life; and during
 their year of office they processed the litigation presented to the most important of the <span class="term">
 <span class="term">dikasteria</span>
 </span>, and presided over trials held there, although in this capacity they were by now
 little more than non-voting (and non-speaking) chairmen. The three senior <span class="term">arkhons</span> each had a specific title and competence: the
 <span class="term">arkhon</span> (the eponymous official of Athens who gave his name to the civil year) heard cases involving family
 and inheritance matters of citizens; the <span class="term">arkhon basileus</span> (lit. ‘king
 arkhon’) presided over religious matters, including sacrilege and homicide;
 the <span class="term">polemarkhos</span> (lit. ‘war arkhon,’ but by now all his
 military functions had been handed over to the <span class="term">strategoi</span>) dealt with family
 and inheritance cases involving metics and apparently cases involving certain other
 privileged foreigners also. The other six arkhons were called <span class="term">thesmothetai</span>
 (sing. <span class="term">thesmothetes</span>: originally perhaps ‘establisher of
 judgements’ rather than ‘maker of laws’); they heard those
 public cases, and perhaps also some private ones, which did not fall within the competence
 of the three senior arkhons or of other named officials. </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ἄρχων, ἄρχοντες</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="astunomos"><h2><span class="headingNumber">12. </span><span class="head">astunomos</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>astunomos</em>, pl. <span class="term">astunomoi</span> · Lit. ‘one who
 regulates (affairs within) the <span class="term">astu</span> (the built-up area of Athens).’ A board of public officials charged with
 the general supervisory duties which we associate with the police. Unlike the police,
 however, they did not undertake the investigation of crime. Nor were they much concerned
 with the arrest or punishment of accused or convicted criminals: this role was played by
 the <span class="term">Eleven</span>. </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ἀστυνόμος, ἀστυνόμοι</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="atimia"><h2><span class="headingNumber">13. </span><span class="head">atimia</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>atimia</em> (abstract noun) · Lit. ‘loss of <span class="term">time</span>,
 honour.’ In early archaic Athens,
 <span class="term">atimia</span> seems to have meant outlawry, the total deprivation of all rights,
 such that a citizen could kill an <span class="term">atimos</span> (pl. <span class="term">atimoi</span>: person
 suffering from <span class="term">atimia</span>) without committing an offence or apparently incurring
 blood-guilt. Well before the classical period, however, <span class="term">atimia</span> had already
 been restricted in its scope to mean the loss of some or all of a man’s active
 rights as a citizen. Such <span class="term">atimia</span> could be partial or total; it could be
 imposed permanently by a court, or it could be the (theoretically) temporary result of an
 unpaid debt to the state, a condition which would automatically terminate if the debt were
 ever paid off. A man subject to total <span class="term">atimia</span> could not appear in certain
 public places, could not take part in public life, and could not appear in court. If he
 broke any of these bans, he was liable to <span class="term">apagoge</span> and death. But he did retain his private rights as a citizen: to kill
 him would be murder; he was not formally exiled; and he continued to own his
 property—though his lack of the capacity to sue may have made it difficult
 procedurally to defend these rights, and many may have found life under such restrictions
 so intolerable that voluntary exile seemed preferable. A man subject to partial
 <span class="term">atimia</span> lost either a particular right or rights, or else the power to
 exercise his rights in a particular situation: for instance, the ability to bring certain
 types of prosecution. </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ἀτιμία</span> (loss of <span class="foreign">τιμή</span>).</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="basileus"><h2><span class="headingNumber">14. </span><span class="head">basileus</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>basileus</em> See sv. arkhon.</p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">βασιλεύς</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="boule"><h2><span class="headingNumber">15. </span><span class="head">boule</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>boule</em> · Lit. ‘<span class="term">council</span>.’ The democratic <span class="term">council</span> of 500
 men, appointed annually by lot from among citizens aged at least thirty, and with severe
 restrictions on repeated membership. Its chief function was to prepare the agenda for
 meetings of the <span class="term">ekklesia</span>, and to undertake certain routine
 administrative duties, in particular that of co-ordinating the activities of numerous
 boards of minor officials; but it had also certain independent judicial powers, mainly but
 not only in cases of limited importance: in some cases of <span class="term">eisangelia</span>, the <span class="term">boule</span> could decide
 whether to refer the trial to the <span class="term">ekklesia</span> or to a
 <span class="term">dikasterion</span>.</p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">βουλή</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="boulomenos"><h2><span class="headingNumber">16. </span><span class="head">(ho) boulomenos</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>(ho) boulomenos</em> · Lit. ‘anyone who wishes.’
 Whereas prosecution in a <span class="term">
 <span class="term">dike</span>
 </span> could only be brought by the aggrieved party, in a <span class="term">graphe</span> or other public case it could be brought by
 any qualified person (which normally meant any Athenian citizen who was not himself <span class="term">atimos</span>). </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">ὁ βουλόμενος</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="diadikasia"><h2><span class="headingNumber">17. </span><span class="head">diadikasia</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>diadikasia</em> · Lit. ‘judgement (contested)
 between’: a dispute between two people who each claim the same thing, in
 particular a contested inheritance. </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">διαδικασία</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="diaitetes"><h2><span class="headingNumber">18. </span><span class="head">diaitetes</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>diaitetes</em>, pl. <span class="term">diaitetai</span> · An arbitrator. Throughout
 the history of Athenian law, it had always been open for litigants to arrange arbitration
 (<span class="term">diaita</span>) on a private basis: in theory, the decision of a private
 arbitrator was binding, presumably because the litigants had voluntarily contracted to
 accept it. There was also, however, a system of public arbitration, introduced <span class="date">c. 400 BCE</span>: every hoplite (or possibly every citizen), in the year
 that he ceased to be eligible for military service at the age of 59, had to serve as
 public arbitrator; and every <span class="term">dike</span> (private
 dispute) was allocated by lot to one of them for an attempt at preliminary resolution. In
 such cases arbitration was compulsory (litigants were obliged to attend) but it was not
 binding (a dissatisfied litigant could refuse to accept the verdict: see sv. <span class="term">ephesis</span>). According to Aristotle, the job of the arbitrator (private or public) is unlike that of the
 <span class="term">dikastes</span> in several respects: he should try to reconcile the parties before
 imposing a solution; he has the discretion to bring in a decision mid-way between the
 demands of the litigants; and in his judgement he should look to epieikeia
 (‘equity,’ but see further sv. <span class="term">epieikeia</span>) rather than to <span class="term">dike</span>
 (‘justice’). </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">διαιτητής, διαιτηταί</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="diamarturia"><h2><span class="headingNumber">19. </span><span class="head">diamarturia</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>diamarturia</em> · A formal presentation of a witness
 (<span class="term">martus</span>) whose evidence serves to compel the public official before whom it
 is presented either to act in a certain way, or (more commonly) to desist from so acting.
 As a result of the introduction of <span class="term">paragraphe</span> around <span class="date">400</span> BCE, the scope of
 <span class="term">diamarturia</span> was soon rapidly restricted: after <span class="date">380</span> BCE, its only attested use is in inheritance cases, where a legitimate son
 could have a claim by a more remote relative quashed on the grounds that the case was not
 actionable; to re-open the case, the rival claimant would have successfully to prosecute
 the witness by <span class="term">dike
 pseudomarturion</span>.</p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">διαμαρτυρία</span>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="section" id="dike"><h2><span class="headingNumber">20. </span><span class="head">dike</span></h2>
 
 <p><em>dike</em>, pl. <span class="term">dikai</span> · A concept of wide scope:
 ‘justice,’
 ‘good order,’
 ‘judgement.’ But it can also refer to the process by which a just
 settlement is determined, thus ‘a lawsuit,’
 ‘a trial,’ and even ‘the case which one pleads’ or
 ‘the penalty which one has to pay.’ In the sence of
 ‘lawsuit,’
 <span class="term">dike</span> can be used either generically, to refer to any type of indictment, or
 else (more commonly) in a semi-technical sense, to denote the older ‘private
 suit’ (which only the aggrieved party or his immediate or his immediate
 personal representatives could bring) as opposed to the newer ‘public
 suit’ (<span class="term">graphe</span>), which could be
 brought by any citizen in good standing; it should however be noted that the category of
 public procedure was broader than that of <span class="term">graphe</span>, and included a number of extraordinary procedures which were not
 themselves <span class="term">graphai</span>, see for instance svv. <span class="term">apagoge</span>, <span class="term">apophasis</span>, <span class="term">eisangelia</span>, <span class="term">euthunai</span>, <span class="term">phasis</span>.</p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">δίκη, δίκαι</span>.</p>
 <p>Note: It seems that these indictments in Athenian law were only allowed if use of the
 dike or <span class="term">graphe</span> procedure against a particular
 offence was authorised by statute; whether the defendant’s alleged behavior fell
 within the terms of this offence could of course be a matter for debate. An indictment was
 normally described as a dike (or <span class="term">graphe</span>, as
 appropriate), qualified by the name of the offence, usually in the genitive case: thus

 <p><em>ephesis</em> · Refusal to accept the decision of an official or a court
 of first instance, combined with a demand for the dispute to be resolved by a higher
 authority. For instance, Solon in the <span class="date">590s</span> is said to have introduced ‘ephesis to the
 dikasterion’ as a curb on the summary jurisdiction of public officials; and
 from their introduction in c. <span class="date">400</span> B.C., the decisions of public
 arbitrators were similarly subject to <span class="term">ephesis</span>. <span class="term">Ephesis</span> is
 traditionally translated ‘appeal,’ but this can have misleading
 connotations. An appeal in English law is brought on the initiative of a dissatisfied
 litigant (in criminal cases, a convicted defendant) after the court of first instance has
 decided against him/her; it is his/her duty to persuade the appellate court to reverse the
 decision, and s/he becomes in a sense the plaintiff in the process. In Athens, there were at least some situations in which
 <span class="term">ephesis</span> could take place before the lower authority had reached a decision;
 it was the duty of the original plaintiff, not of the dissatisfied litigant, to persuade
 the court to act (that it, the court was retrying the case from scratch and not reviewing
 a decision already made); and it is possible that in the case of Solonian
 <span class="term">ephesis</span>, this referral was automatic and did not depend on an initiative
 taken by one of the two litigants. </p>

 it is the function of the <span class="term">dikastes</span> (juror/judge) to judge according to <span class="term">

 conventional therefore to translate <span class="term">epieikeia</span> as ‘equity,’
 since this is a standard and convenient way to describe ‘fairness’ or
 ‘natural justice’ as opposed to the strict application of legal
 rules. There are however certain problems here. ‘Equity’ in English law
 can mean simply ‘fairness,’ but it is also the name given to the system
 of law developed originally by the Court of Chancery (the Lord Chancellor’s
 court), to provide relief in cases where to apply the rules of the common law would have
 seemed manifestly unfair. ‘Equity’ in this sense is itself a body of
 rules; it is found only in countries which base their legal system on the common law; and
 it is clearly not what Aristotle is talking about. It
 should indeed be noted that Aristotle’s
 statement of theory receives little acknowledgment in Athenian practice: when a litigant

 returned to the house of her family, this would normally be her father or (failing him)
 her brother or paternal uncle, but it could even be her adult son. A married woman was

 certain rights: for instance, the reversion of her dowry. Confusingly, the term
 <span class="term">kurios</span> was also used to denote the owner of property or the master of a

 child of an unmarried union between citizen and non-citizen was clearly illegitimate, and
 had rights neither of inheritance nor of <span class="term">citizenship</span>.

 <p><em>sunegoros</em>, pl. <span class="term">sunegoroi</span> · Most commonly, a person who
 appears in court to speak on behalf of a litigant. Lit ‘speaker together
 with,’ thus at least in theory preserving the rule that litigants could not be
 represented by advocates: the <span class="term">sunegoros</span> was officially the supporting
 speaker. The word is also used to describe a speaker appointed to represent the state,
 normally as prosecutor; but the overwhelming majority even of public prosecutions were
 brought by private individuals. </p>
 <p>Greek: <span class="foreign">συνήγορος, συνήγοροι</span>.</p>
