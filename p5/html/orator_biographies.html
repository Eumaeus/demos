<div class="section" id="antiphon"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Antiphon</span></h2>


<p>Antiphon son of Sophilus of the deme Rhamnous (ca. <span class="date">480-411</span>) is the first of the canonical Attic orators. He was the first Athenian to compose and publish speeches written for delivery by others. Antiphon appears not to have taken an active role in Athenian politics until <span class="date">411</span>, when he masterminded the oligarchic revolution resulting in the brief reign of the <span class="term">Four Hundred</span>. When the <span class="term">Four Hundred</span> were removed from power, Antiphon was tried for treason and condemned to death (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">[Plut.] <span class="titlem">Moralia</span> 834a-b</span>) despite delivering the best defense speech in a capital case which Thucydides had ever heard (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.68</span>; for fragments of the speech see <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Gagarin fr. 1</span>).</p> 

<p>Antiphon’s surviving works include three forensic speeches (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">5</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">6</span>) and three <span class="titlem">Tetralogies</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">2</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">3</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">4</span>), all dealing with <span class="term">homicide</span>. The <span class="titlem">Tetralogies</span>, perhaps composed as early as the <span class="date">440s</span>, are sets of model speeches in hypothetical <span class="term">homicide</span> cases; each consists of two speeches for the prosecution and two for the defense. Antiphon’s forensic speeches, written for litigants in actual Athenian homicide trials, can be dated to the decade preceding his death. Although the aforementioned works all concern <span class="term">homicide</span>, the surviving fragments of Antiphon deal with a number of issues, from the tribute of Athenian allies (<span class="bibl">fr. A1-2 Maidment</span>) to a lawsuit regarding peacocks (<span class="bibl">fr. B12 Maidment</span>). In addition, ‘Antiphon the sophist,’ the author of the works <span class="titlem">On Truth</span> and <span class="titlem">On Concord</span>, is probably to be identified with Antiphon the orator.

<div class="section" id="andocides"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Andocides</span></h2>


<p>Andocides son of Leogoras (ca. <span class="date">440-post 391</span>) came from a wealthy Athenian family and belonged to a <span class="term"><span class="term">hetaireia</span></span>, an oligarchic political club. Andocides and his <span class="term"><span class="term">hetaireia</span></span> attained notoriety as a result of the <span class="term">Hermocopid</span> conspiracy of <span class="date">415</span>. One morning soon before the scheduled departure of the Sicilian expedition, the Athenians awoke to discover that the majority of the herms (ithyphallic stone pillars topped with the head of Hermes, god of travelers) in Athens had suffered mutilation. This, together with a report of the profanation of the Eleusinian Mysteries, threw Athens into an uproar. Among those accused in connection with the two scandals were Andocides and some of his relatives, including his father, who were thrown into prison to await condemnation. In return for a grant of immunity, Andocides confessed that his <span class="term"><span class="term">hetaireia</span></span> had been responsible for the vandalism. Thus Andocides and his relatives were spared, but a number of his friends were executed.</p>

<p>Andocides’ subsequent unpopularity led to the passage of the ‘<span class="term">Isotimides</span> decree,’ which barred anyone who had confessed to an act of impiety from entering the temples and agora of Athens. As a result, Andocides went into exile. He twice attempted to return to Athens without success: once in <span class="date">411</span>, during the regime of the <span class="term">Four Hundred</span>, and again after the restoration of the democracy. In support of his second attempt he delivered the speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On his Return’ (2)</span>. The <span class="term">Amnesty</span> of <span class="date">403</span> finally allowed Andocides to return home; but in <span class="date">400</span> he was put on trial for violating the <span class="term">Isotimides</span> decree. He won an acquittal with his defense speech, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Mysteries’ (1)</span>, which is one of our most valuable sources of information regarding the scandals of <span class="date">415</span>.</p>

<p>In <span class="date">392/1</span> Andocides went to Sparta as a member of an Athenian embassy to discuss peace. Upon the return of the ambassadors, he delivered the speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Peace with the Spartans’ (3)</span> in support of Sparta’s offer. The Athenians rejected the offer; the ambassadors, facing accusations of corruption, fled the city. No subsequent details of Andocides’ life are known. (See also Oratory.)</p>

<div class="section" id="lysias"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Lysias</span></h2>


<p>Lysias son of Cephalus (<span class="date">459/8-post 380</span>) was a <span class="term">metic</span> (a resident alien) whose father moved to Athens from Syracuse at the invitation of Pericles. As a teenager he moved to Thurii, where he studied rhetoric; he was banished after the Sicilian expedition ended in disaster and returned to Athens, where he and his brother Polemarchus prospered as owners of a shield-making business.</p>

<p>When the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span> came to power in <span class="date">404/3</span>, they seized the brothers’ assets and put Polemarchus to death; Lysias barely escaped to Megara. Upon the restoration of the democracy in <span class="date">403</span>, Lysias was awarded Athenian <span class="term">citizenship</span> by a decree of Thrasybulus rewarding <span class="term">metics</span> who had aided the return of the exiled democrats; but the decree was soon repealed, and Lysias returned to metic status. Also in <span class="date">403</span> Lysias prosecuted the former tyrant Eratosthenes for the killing of Polemarchus. The verdict in the trial is unknown; but the speech Lysias delivered, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Eratosthenes’ (12)</span>, is one of the most important sources we have for the reign of the <span class="term">Thirty</span>, as is <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Agoratus’ (13)</span>, written by Lysias for another litigant.</p>

<p>From <span class="date">403</span> to his death Lysias worked as a professional speechwriter. Of the hundreds of speeches ascribed to Lysias in antiquity, 35 survive today; in addition we have a number of fragments. Lysias composed speeches dealing with a wide variety of issues, ranging from <span class="term">homicide</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">12</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">13</span>) to intentional wounding (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">3</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">4</span>), slander (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">10</span>), <span class="term"><span class="term">dokimasiai</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">26</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">31</span>), and a disability pension (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">24</span>). Lysias’ prose was widely admired in antiquity for its <span class="term">charis</span> (grace, pleasantness) and <span class="term">ethopoiia</span> (portrayal of the speaker’s character). (See also Oratory.)</p>

<div class="section" id="isocrates"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">Isocrates</span></h2>


<p>Isocrates son of Theodorus (<span class="date">436-338</span>) came from a prosperous Athenian family and studied philosophy as well as rhetoric in his youth. For roughly a decade after the Peloponnesian War, which greatly reduced his family’s assets, Isocrates worked as a speechwriter; six of his forensic speeches (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">16</span>-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">21</span>) survive. Around <span class="date">390</span>, however, he gave up speechwriting (a profession he would later vilify) and turned to teaching. Isocrates’ educational program professed to combine the art of rhetoric with the pursuit of morality; he thus distinguished himself both from pure theoreticians and from those concerned only with persuasion regardless of truth. His students included the historians Theopompus of Chios and Ephorus of Cyme, the orators Isaeus, Hypereides, and Lycurgus, and the general Timotheus.</p>

<p>Isocrates did not participate in Athenian politics in person; he attempted to influence policy by publishing written pamphlets and letters rather than by delivering speeches in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. Although he was careful to employ the rhetoric of democracy, Isocrates displayed marked oligarchic tendencies; for example, in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Areopagiticus’ (7)</span>. He also made his voice heard regarding foreign policy: he was a strident advocate of panhellenism, and his foremost goal was a united Greek invasion of Persia. In the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Panegyricus’ (4)</span>, published in <span class="date">380</span> after at least ten years of composition, Isocrates proposed an expedition under the joint command of Athens and Sparta. But the subsequent rise of Philip II of Macedon provided Isocrates with a new choice of hegemon, and he appealed repeatedly to Philip (in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Philippus’ (5)</span> of <span class="date">346</span> and in <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Epistles 2</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">3</span>) to lead the Greeks against Persia. Disappointed by the results of the battle of Chaeroneia in <span class="date">338</span>, Isocrates starved himself to death, and thus did not live to see his proposal put into effect by Philip’s son and successor, Alexander the Great.

<div class="section" id="isaeus"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">Isaeus</span></h2>


<p>Isaeus son of Diagoras (ca. <span class="date">420-post 344/3</span>) is one of the least well-known Attic orators. The ancients themselves could not agree on whether he was Athenian or Chalcidian by birth. A student of Isocrates, he worked as a speechwriter and also taught the art of rhetoric; his most famous student was Demosthenes. Isaeus’ specialty was inheritance law, a difficult and fruitful area of litigation even by Athenian standards (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">[Arist.] <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 9.2</span>). The eleven speeches of Isaeus which survive entire (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1</span>-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">11</span>) are all concerned, directly or indirectly, with inheritance disputes; the speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘For Euphiletus’ (12)</span> deals with the restoration of <span class="term">citizenship</span>. (See also Oratory.)</p>

</div>

 

<div class="section" id="demosthenes"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">Demosthenes</span></h2>


<p><a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1997.99.0388"></a>Demosthenes son of Demosthenes of the deme Paeania (<span class="date">384-322</span>) is generally regarded as the greatest of the Attic orators. At the age of seven he lost his father and was entrusted, along with his inheritance, to guardians. When he turned eighteen, however, he discovered that most of the money was gone; and so, after studying under Isaeus, Demosthenes took his guardians to court in <span class="date">364</span>. He delivered his first speeches (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">27</span>-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">31</span>) in these cases, and their success launched his career as a speechwriter.</p>

<p>Demosthenes’ long and illustrious political career began in <span class="date">355</span>, when he composed speeches for the trials of Androtion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">22</span>) and Leptines (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">20</span>). In the latter half of the <span class="date">350s</span> he continued to write forensic speeches for high-profile cases (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">24 ‘Against Timocrates’</span>, <span class="date">353</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">23 ‘Against Aristocrates’</span>, <span class="date">352</span>), and also delivered his first speeches before the Athenian <span class="term">Assembly</span>, including <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Symmories’ (14)</span> in <span class="date">354</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘For the Megalopolitans’ (13)</span> in <span class="date">353</span>, and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Liberty of the Rhodians’ (15)</span> in <span class="date">351</span>.</p>

<p>Demosthenes rose to prominence as the foremost Athenian opponent of Philip II. In <span class="date">351</span> he delivered his <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘First Philippic’ (4)</span>, in which he called for a more aggressive stance toward the rising threat of Macedon. In the three ‘Olynthiacs’ (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1</span>-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">3</span>) of <span class="date">348</span> he urged his countrymen to send aid to Olynthus, which was under Macedonian attack; but the auxiliary expeditions sent by Athens could not prevent Philip’s capture of the city. In <span class="date">346</span> Demosthenes took part in the embassies to Philip regarding the ‘Peace of Philocrates;’ on his return from the second embassy he accused several fellow ambassadors, including Aeschines, of taking bribes from Philip, and he attacked Philip for negotiating in bad faith. Despite his dissatisfaction, later in the year he delivered the speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Peace’ (5)</span>, counseling the Athenians to abide by its terms.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the decade Demosthenes continued to agitate against Philip at home and abroad, delivering the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Second Philippic’ (6)</span> in <span class="date">344</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Chersonese’ (8)</span> and the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Third Philippic’ (9)</span> in <span class="date">341</span>. In <span class="date">343</span> Demosthenes brought Aeschines to trial and gave the oration <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the False Embassy’ (19)</span>; Aeschines escaped a death sentence by a mere thirty votes. Demosthenes’ policy of resistance to Philip triumphed, but the resistance itself failed at the battle of Chaeroneia in <span class="date">338</span>. Nonetheless, Demosthenes remained influential at Athens. In <span class="date">336</span> Ctesiphon proposed that Demosthenes be awarded a gold crown for his public services; Aeschines brought an indictment against Ctesiphon for making an <span class="term">illegal proposal</span>, but the case did not go to trial until <span class="date">330</span>. At Ctesiphon’s trial Demosthenes delivered his most famous oration, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Crown’ (18)</span>, and Aeschines was soundly defeated.</p>

<p>Philip’s assassination in <span class="date">336</span> led to an abortive attempt at revolt in which Demosthenes played a prominent role. For a while afterwards the Athenians acclimated themselves to Macedonian hegemony. In <span class="date">324-323</span>, however, Demosthenes was implicated in a scandal involving Harpalus, the fugitive treasurer of Alexander the Great. Accused of appropriating twenty talents of the funds Harpalus had brought to Athens, Demosthenes was convicted, fined, and imprisoned for failure to pay, but escaped and went into exile. Upon Alexander’s death in <span class="date">323</span> he returned to Athens and again advised resistance to Macedon. After Antipater’s defeat of the Greek rebels in the ‘Lamian War,’ Demosthenes, facing a death sentence, committed suicide by poison. (See also Oratory.)</p>

<div class="section" id="aeschines"><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">Aeschines</span></h2>


<p><a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1997.99.0389"></a>Aeschines son of Atrometus of the deme Cothocidae (<span class="date">390-ca. 322</span>) was an actor before becoming a politician, for which he is repeatedly lampooned by Demosthenes. He served on the Athenian embassies to Philip regarding the ‘Peace of Philocrates;’ in the period which followed his support for the peace brought him into constant conflict with Demosthenes. Upon his return from the second embassy in <span class="date">346</span> he was accused of taking Macedonian bribes by Demosthenes and his associate Timarchus. He counterattacked by prosecuting Timarchus for speaking in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> after having prostituted himself, and won his case with the oration <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Timarchus’ (1)</span>. When Demosthenes revived the allegations of bribery in <span class="date">343</span>, Aeschines defended himself with the speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the False Embassy’ (2)</span>. He barely escaped conviction, and his influence was clearly on the wane.</p>

<p>In spring <span class="date">339</span>, as an Athenian representative at the meeting of the <span class="term">Amphictyonic League</span>, Aeschines successfully deflected the wrath of the League from Athens onto Amphissa. However, the Fourth Sacred War against Amphissa bore bitter fruit for the Athenians as well, as it brought Philip into central Greece and eventually led to the battle of Chaeroneia. In <span class="date">336</span> Aeschines indicted Ctesiphon for proposing the grant of a gold crown to Demosthenes. When the case came to trial six years later, Aeschines delivered his oration <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Ctesiphon’ (3)</span>. Despite the legal merits of his case, he received less than twenty percent of the jury’s votes, and he left Athens to teach rhetoric on Rhodes. (See also Oratory.)</p>

<div class="section" id="hyperides"><h2><span class="headingNumber">9. </span><span class="head">Hypereides</span></h2>


<p>Hypereides son of Glaucippus of the deme Collytus (<span class="date">390/89-322</span>) was a wealthy Athenian with a reputation as a trencherman and patron of high-class prostitutes. He was already influential in Athenian politics when he joined forces with Demosthenes to resist Philip of Macedon. In <span class="date">343</span> Hypereides impeached Philocrates, author of the peace of <span class="date">346</span>, and secured a conviction. In <span class="date">341</span> he went as ambassador to Rhodes, and possibly to Chios, to drum up support against Philip; and in <span class="date">340</span> and <span class="date">339</span> he was active in Athenian naval operations.</p>

<p>Hypereides continued his hard-line anti-Macedonian stance after the loss at Chaeroneia: his speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Philippides’ (2)</span>, for example, attacks an illegal proposal made by Philippides awarding honors to Macedonians. He also found himself repeatedly at odds with Lycurgus, who brought numerous impeachments against Athenian citizens. Two of Hypereides’ surviving speeches (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1 ‘For Lycophron’</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">4 ‘For Euxenippus’</span>) were delivered for the defense in impeachments; in both cases Lycurgus was involved in the prosecution.</p>

<p>Hypereides was appointed one of the special prosecutors in the Harpalus affair; fragments of his speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Demosthenes’ (5)</span>, which helped convict his former associate, survive. After the death of Alexander the Great in <span class="date">323</span>, Hypereides led the war party in Athens and traveled abroad to win allies; accordingly, in <span class="date">322</span>, he was chosen to deliver the funeral oration (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">6</span>) in honor of the Athenian dead in the Lamian War. Later that year, after the rebels were defeated, Hypereides was hunted down by order of Antipater and executed. (See also Oratory.)</p>

<div class="section" id="lycurgus"><h2><span class="headingNumber">10. </span><span class="head">Lycurgus</span></h2>


<p>Lycurgus son of Lycophron of the deme Boutadae (ca. <span class="date">390-324</span>) belonged to one of Athens’ most distinguished families, the <span class="term">Eteoboutads</span>. Rising to prominence after the battle of Chaeroneia, Lycurgus administered the Athenian state treasury from <span class="date">336</span> until his death. During his tenure he increased revenues, enlarged the fleet and renovated its dockyards, and oversaw a public building program. In addition, he may have reorganized the ephebic system, under which Athenian men in their first two years of adulthood underwent military training and patrolled the border of Attica.</p>

<p>An extremely pious man, Lycurgus legislated often regarding religious cults and festivals. He also saw himself as a moral reformer; as such he involved himself in numerous prosecutions, favoring especially the procedure of <span class="term"><span class="term">eisangelia</span></span> (impeachment). His sole surviving speech, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Leocrates’</span>, was delivered in an impeachment for treason. Some of his contemporaries, including Hypereides, objected that Lycurgus was overly zealous in his use of <span class="term"><span class="term">eisangelia</span></span> and impeached men for petty offenses. So vigorous was Lycurgus in his prosecution of wrongdoers that it was said that he anointed his pen not with ink but with death (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">[Plut.] <span class="titlem">Moralia</span> 841e (<span class="titlem">Vit. X Or.</span>)</span>). In <span class="date">307/6</span> the Athenians honored Lycurgus’ memory by erecting a bronze statue of him in the Ceramicus. (See also Oratory.)</p>

<div class="section" id="apollodorus"><h2><span class="headingNumber">11. </span><span class="head">Apollodoros</span></h2>


<p>[This biography was written by Konstantinos Kapparis]</p>

<p>Apollodoros, son of Pasion of Acharnai. Apollodoros was born in <span class="date">394</span> BC. He was the son of the wealthy banker Pasion and his wife Archippe. Apollodoros was brought up in an affluent household and as a young man he was rather ostentatious, perhaps trying to overcome prejudice among the upper strata of Athenian society for his humble origins (see <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">J. Trevett <span class="titlem">Apollodoros, the Son of Pasion</span>, Oxford 1992</span>). He tells us that he walked fast and had a loud voice. He married the daughter of Deinias of Athmonon, and had two daughters, one of whom was married to his brother-in-law Theomnestos. He had political ambitions, served as a member of the <span class="term">Boule</span> in <span class="date">348/7</span>, introduced a decree seeking to expand the resources available for the campaign against Philip, remained a staunch supporter of the anti-Macedonian party, and maintained political alliances with prominent Athenians such as Demosthenes, and even Euboulos in his final years in office. After the death of his father he engaged in prolonged litigation with his younger brother Pasikles over the estate of Pasion. Of the speeches delivered in these court cases we only have the second speech ‘Against Stephanos’ (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 46</span>) written by the hand of Apollodoros. This text is a valuable source of Athenian law because the strategy of Apollodoros in this case was to hit the jury with a barrage of statutes governing inheritance and succession in order to suggest that the law was on his side.</p>

<p>Another six speeches transmitted in the manuscripts of Demosthenes were written by Apollodoros (in chronological order: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 53</span> ‘Against Nikostratos,’ <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 52</span> ‘Against Kallippos,’ <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 49</span> ‘Against Timotheos,’ <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 50</span> ‘Against Polycles,’ <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47</span> ‘Against Euergos and Mnesiboulos,’ <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59</span> ‘Against Neaira’). The reason why these speeches survived is probably because they were mistaken for speeches of Demosthenes. However, for us this was a fortunate mistake, as Apollodoros had detailed knowledge of Athenian law and legal procedure, and was always eager to quote laws, decrees, oaths, and other such documents in his speeches. The strengths of Apollodoros as an orator lie in his legal expertise, a truly captivating narrative, skillful manipulation of the jury’s prejudices and fears, morally ambiguous, fascinating characters, and an overall richness that has made his speeches popular samples of Attic oratory.

<div class="section" id="dinarchus"><h2><span class="headingNumber">12. </span><span class="head">Deinarchus</span></h2>


<p>Deinarchus son of Sostratus (ca. <span class="date">360-post 292/1</span>) was a <span class="term">metic</span> from Corinth. After studying rhetoric under Theophrastus at the Lyceum, he enjoyed a long and successful career as a speechwriter. He composed speeches for one of the special prosecutors in the Harpalus affair, a scandal in which many prominent Athenians were prosecuted for corruption. His three surviving orations (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1 ‘Against Demosthenes’</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">2 ‘Against Aristogeiton’</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">3 ‘Against Philocles’</span>) come from these trials. The last (and, according to many critics, the least) of the canonical Attic orators, Deinarchus enjoyed the patronage of Demetrius of Phaleron during his decade in power (<span class="date">317-307</span>). When Demetrius I Poliorcetes captured Athens in <span class="date">307</span>, Deinarchus fled to Chalcis, remaining there until Theophrastus arranged his homecoming in <span class="date">292/1</span>. Soon thereafter he brought suit against Proxenus, who hosted him upon his return; the subsequent fate of Deinarchus is unknown. (See also Oratory.)</p>
