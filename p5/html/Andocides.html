<p>Andocides son of Leogoras (ca. <span class="date">440-post 391</span>) came from a wealthy Athenian family and belonged to a <span class="term"><span class="term">hetaireia</span></span>, an oligarchic political club. Andocides and his <span class="term"><span class="term">hetaireia</span></span> attained notoriety as a result of the <span class="term">Hermocopid</span> conspiracy of <span class="date">415</span>. One morning soon before the scheduled departure of the Sicilian expedition, the Athenians awoke to discover that the majority of the herms (ithyphallic stone pillars topped with the head of Hermes, god of travelers) in Athens had suffered mutilation. This, together with a report of the profanation of the Eleusinian Mysteries, threw Athens into an uproar. Among those accused in connection with the two scandals were Andocides and some of his relatives, including his father, who were thrown into prison to await condemnation. In return for a grant of immunity, Andocides confessed that his <span class="term"><span class="term">hetaireia</span></span> had been responsible for the vandalism. Thus Andocides and his relatives were spared, but a number of his friends were executed.</p>

<p>Andocides’ subsequent unpopularity led to the passage of the ‘<span class="term">Isotimides</span> decree,’ which barred anyone who had confessed to an act of impiety from entering the temples and agora of Athens. As a result, Andocides went into exile. He twice attempted to return to Athens without success: once in <span class="date">411</span>, during the regime of the <span class="term">Four Hundred</span>, and again after the restoration of the democracy. In support of his second attempt he delivered the speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On his Return’ (2)</span>. The <span class="term">Amnesty</span> of <span class="date">403</span> finally allowed Andocides to return home; but in <span class="date">400</span> he was put on trial for violating the <span class="term">Isotimides</span> decree. He won an acquittal with his defense speech, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Mysteries’ (1)</span>, which is one of our most valuable sources of information regarding the scandals of <span class="date">415</span>.</p>

<p>In <span class="date">392/1</span> Andocides went to Sparta as a member of an Athenian embassy to discuss peace. Upon the return of the ambassadors, he delivered the speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the Peace with the Spartans’ (3)</span> in support of Sparta’s offer. The Athenians rejected the offer; the ambassadors, facing accusations of corruption, fled the city. No subsequent details of Andocides’ life are known. (See also Oratory.)</p>
