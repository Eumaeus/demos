<p>Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Against Macartatus</span>, see also Oratory. This speech is generally not held to be the work of Demosthenes, whose speeches are characterised by a less pompous tone. The lawsuit in question is the third in a string of attempts to settle the estate of Hagnias of Oeon, an Athenian ambassador who was captured and murdered by Sparta. According to the <span class="titlem">Hellenica Oxyrhynchia</span>, Hagnias and his travelling companion, Telesegorus, were sent to Persia as ambassadors from Athens (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">Hell. Oxy.</span> 2.1</span>). While on their way, they were captured by the Spartan commander Pharax, who sent them off to Sparta to be killed. References to other events in the passage from the <span class="titlem">Hellenica Oxyrhynchia</span> allow the date of Hagnias’ death to be placed at <span class="date">396 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl">E.S. Forster, <span class="titlem">Isaeus</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1943] 382</span>) during the Corinthian War. (For an ancient account of the Corinthian War, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 3-5</span>.) The Corinthian War, erupting less than a decade after the end of the Peloponnesian War, pitted Sparta, on one side, against Athens, Argos, Corinth, and Thebes, on the other.</p>
<p>After the death of Hagnias, who had no children, two claimants came forth to contend for his estate: Glaucus and Glaucon, half-brothers of Hagnias, and Eubulides, Hagnias’ first cousin. During the course of the trial, Eubulides died and his daughter, Phylomache, assumed the suit on his behalf and was awarded the estate. A second lawsuit was then raised contesting the decision of the first one. This new suit involved four parties: Phylomache, Theopompus, Glaucus and Glaucon, and Eupolemus. The judgement in this case was for Theopompus, who apparently proved to the satisfaction of the court that Phylomache’s lineage was false and that her grandmother, also named Phylomache, never existed and could not, consequently, have been the sister of Polemon (Hagnias’ father). It was apparently of no concern to the court that Theopompus was so distantly related to Hagnias that he could only claim kinship through a brother of his grandfather. Nevertheless, the estate of Hagnias was awarded to Theopompus and, upon Theopompus’ death, was passed on to his son Macartatus. At this point a third lawsuit was brought before the court with which the present speech has to do. In this instance, Sositheus (the husband of Phylomache) sues Macartatus in the name of his (Sositheus’) son, Eubulides. In order to do this, Sositheus has caused his son to be named the legal heir of the older Eubulides, the son’s maternal grandfather, thus taking the place of Phylomache. In his speech, Sositheus blames the result of the second trial on a conspiracy between the four individuals who contended with his wife (Phylomache) for the estate. Because of this conspiracy, Sositheus claims that a new trial is necessary. He also goes to great lengths to prove that Theopompus’ relation to Hagnias was very remote indeed and that Theopompus cared nothing for Hagnias but instead wanted the estate for the money that its olive trees would yield (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 43.69</span>). As we have seen, the <span class="titlem">Hellenica Oxyrhynchia</span> has given scholars an independent source wherewith to date the death of Hagnias (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">Hell. Oxy.</span> 2.1</span>). Mention of the archonship of Nicophemus (<span class="date">361-360 BCE</span>) in this speech has traditionally allowed it to be given a date of later than <span class="date">360 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 43.31</span>) (source for date: <span class="bibl">A.T. Murray, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes II</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 3</span>). It is important to bear in mind, however, that when a speech mentions a ‘deposition’, it is very likely that the quotation was not part of the original speech, but was added later; this means that such quotations are not always trustworthy. For further information on this case, see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isaeus 11</span>.</p>
