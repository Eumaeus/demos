<div class="Section" id="HistoryEarly"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">The 6th Century BCE</span></h2>


<div class="p">Even before the Athenians established a democracy, the Council played a central role in the government of Athens. Solon, the Athenian legal reformer of the <span class="date">6th century BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>), established a Council of 400 citizens, 100 from each of the four traditional tribes (<span class="foreign">βουλὴν δ᾽ ἐποίησε τετρακοσίους, ἑκατὸν ἐξ ἑκάστης φυλῆς</span>), and gave the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> authority as <span class="quote_inline">guardian of the laws</span> (<span class="foreign">ἔταξεν ἐπὶ τὸ νομοφυλακεῖν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 8.4</span>). According to Plutarch, Solon’s Council existed as a check on the power of the people; the 400 Councillors were <span class="quote_inline">to deliberate before the People, and nothing was to be brought before the <span class="term">Assembly</span> without an initial resolution of the Council</span> (<span class="foreign">οὓς προβουλεύειν ἔταξε τοῦ δήμου καὶ μηδὲν ἐᾶν ἀπροβούλευτον εἰς ἐκκλησίαν εἰσφέρεσθαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.1</span>). Plutarch goes on describe the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> and this Council of 400 as <span class="quote_inline">just like anchors</span> (<span class="foreign">ὥσπερ ἀγκύραις</span>), intended to keep the people of Athens quiet (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.2</span>).</div> 

<div class="p">Ironically, the only source that describes this early Council actually acting, describes how the Council allowed Pisistratus to become tyrant of Athens in the middle of the <span class="date">6th century BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). Diogenes Laertius describes how, when Pisistratus was winning favor among the People in his efforts to become tyrant, Solon came before the <span class="term">Assembly</span> wearing a shield and carring a sword, and urged the People to oppose Pisistratus. <span class="quote_inline">But the Council,</span> Diogenes reports, <span class="quote_inline">being of the party of Pisistratus, said that he was insane</span> (<span class="foreign">καὶ ἡ βουλή, Πεισιστρατίδαι ὄντες, μαίνεσθαι ἔλεγον αὐτόν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diog. Laert. 1.49</span>).</div>

<p>The passage from Diogenes Laertius is confusing, however, since Solon appears before the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν</span>), while it is the Council (<span class="foreign">ἡ βουλή</span>) that accuses him of insanity. This confusion, and the general lack of evidence regarding a pre-democratic Council, do raise questions about the existence of this body before the <span class="date">5th century</span>.</p>

<div class="p">On the other hand, in the oligarchic coup of <span class="date">411 BCE</span>, when the democracy was temporarily overthrown, the first act of the oligarchic revolutionaries was to <span class="quote_inline">set up a Council of 400, according to the ways of the ancestors</span> (<span class="foreign">βουλεύειν μὲν τετρακοσίους κατὰ τὰ πάτρια</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 31.1</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). The claim that a Council of 400 was traditional certainly sounds like propaganda, but it might be further evidence that a smaller Council existed before the democracy.</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="HistoryCleisthenes"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Cleisthenes and Ephialtes</span></h2>


<p>When Cleisthenes reformed the government of Athens shortly after <span class="date">508 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>), he replaced the traditional four tribes of Athens with ten new tribes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 5.96</span>) and increased membership in the <span class="term">Council</span> to 500 citizens, fifty from each tribe (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 21.2-4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1319b19-27</span>).</p>

<div class="p">In <span class="date">501</span> or <span class="date">500 BCE</span>, when Hermocreon was archon, Cleisthenes instituted the so-called ‘Bouleutic Oath’, the oath that every citizen swore upon beginning his service on the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.2</span>; source for date, <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">P.J. Rhodes, <span class="titlem">Commentary on the Aristotelian <span class="titlem">Athenaion Politeia</span></span> [Oxford, 1993] 262</span>). Aristotle says that the oath instituted at this time was the same one <span class="quote_inline">which they swear even now <span class="note" id="Note1"> [that is, in Aristotle’s time, the <span class="date">middle of the 4th century BCE</span>]</span></span> (<span class="foreign">ὃν ἔτι καὶ νῦν ὀμνύουσιν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.2</span>).</div>

<div class="p">According to Aristotle, Ephialtes brought about a reform of the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> by denouncing the Court before the <span class="term">Council</span> of 500 (<span class="foreign">τῆς βουλῆς τῶν πεντακοσίων</span>) and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐν τῷ δήμῳ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.4</span>): <blockquote class="quote"><p>First he made away with many of the members of the Council of the <span class="term">Aeropagus</span> by bringing legal proceedings against them about their acts of administration; then in the archonship of Conon he stripped the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> of all its added powers which made it the safeguard of the constitution, and assigned some of them to the <span class="term">Five Hundred</span> and others to the <span class="term">People</span> and to the <span class="term">jury-courts</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.2</span>). The archonship of Conon was the year <span class="date">462/1</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">P.J. Rhodes, <span class="titlem">Aristotle: the Athenian Constitution</span> [Penguin, 1984] 69</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Aristotle is not very clear as to what he means when he says that the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> lost <span class="quote_inline">all its added powers which made it the safeguard of the constitution</span> (<span class="foreign">ἅπαντα περιεῖλε τὰ ἐπίθετα δι᾽ ὧν ἦν ἡ τῆς πολιτείας φυλακή</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.2</span>), and that that power was given to the <span class="term">Council</span> and the <span class="term">Courts</span>. No ancient source, in fact, lists the powers that the <span class="term">Council</span> acquired after the reforms of Ephialtes, but it is possible to make some educated guesses.</div>

<div class="p">We know that the original <span class="term">Council</span>, as Solon set it up, existed <span class="quote_inline">to deliberate before the <span class="term">People</span>, and nothing was to be brought before the <span class="term">Assembly</span> without an initial resolution of the <span class="term">Council</span></span> (<span class="foreign">οὓς προβουλεύειν ἔταξε τοῦ δήμου καὶ μηδὲν ἐᾶν ἀπροβούλευτον εἰς ἐκκλησίαν εἰσφέρεσθαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.1</span>). This is the <span class="term">Council</span>’s ‘probouleutic’ function, the function of ‘planning beforehand.’ In the <span class="date">fourth century</span>, on the other hand, we see that the <span class="term">Council</span> functioned like a court of law or a court of inquiry under certain circumstances, conducting trials of state prosecution (<span class="foreign">εἰσαγγελίαι</span>) and conducting audits of public officials (<span class="foreign">δοκιμασίαι</span>)—these functions are described with citations to the ancient evidence elsewhere in this article and the article on the <span class="term">institution of the Council</span>, but several <span class="date">5th century</span> examples of the <span class="term">Council</span> conducting state prosecutions (<span class="foreign">εἰσαγγελίαι</span>) appear in a speech by Antiphon from <span class="date">412 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Antiph. 6.35</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Antiph. 6.49</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Since Aristotle says that the authority to <span class="quote_inline">safeguard the laws</span> passed from the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> to the <span class="term">Council</span> and the <span class="term">Courts</span> with the reforms of Ephialtes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.2</span>), and since the authority to conduct state prosecutions and audits must have been granted to the <span class="term">Council</span> at some point, we might suppose that these judicial functions were added to the <span class="term">Council</span>’s probouleutic function in <span class="date">462/1 BCE</span>.</div>

<p>Aristotle connects this event to a newfound feeling of power among the common people of Athens following the Persian Wars, when the less wealthy citizens by serving in the navy had saved the city. He makes the connection between naval victories and the reform of the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> explicitly in his <span class="titlem">Politics</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1274a</span>). Also, by <span class="date">462 BCE</span>, when Ephialtes made his reforms, the <span class="term">archons</span> (the future members of the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>) were chosen by lot, not by vote (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 22.5</span>). It is possible that this change made the institution seem less prestigious, and thus worthy of holding fewer powers <span class="note" id="Note2"> [This interesting suggestion is from <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">P.J. Rhodes, <span class="titlem">A Commentary on the Aristotelian <span class="titlem">Athenaion Politeia</span></span> (Oxford, 1993)</span>]</span>.</p>

<p>Aristotle maintains that the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> lost power as Athens became more democratic, while Rhodes suggests that the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> lost power as it became, itself, less aristocratic. There is no reason why both of these causes could not have influenced the Athenians’ willingness to shift power from the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> to the <span class="term">Council</span>, but the ancient theory of Aristotle and the modern theory of Rhodes offer a convincing symmetry.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="History5thc"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">The 5th Century BCE</span></h2>


<p>Most of our evidence regarding the <span class="term">Council</span> comes from the <span class="date">4th century</span>, the speeches by Attic orators (see Oratory) and Aristotle’s <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span>(<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span></span>). But our sources give us a few interesting anecdotes that illustrate the <span class="term">Council</span> in action, as well as some descriptions of the <span class="term">Council</span>’s role in the crises that the Athenian democracy faced during its first 100 years.</p>

<div class="p">Diodorus Siculus gives an anecdote that shows the <span class="term">Council</span> conducting foreign policy in the <span class="date">early 5th century</span>. He says that after the Persian Wars, when the Athenians were planning to fortify their city, the Spartans urged them not to build walls (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.39.4</span>). <blockquote class="quote"><p>While the Athenians were at a loss what they should do, Themistocles, who enjoyed at that time the highest favour among them, advised them to take no action; for he warned them that if they had recourse to force, the Lacedaemonians <span class="note" id="Note3"> [that is, the Spartans]</span> could easily march up against them together with the Peloponnesians and prevent them from fortifying the city. But he told the <span class="term">Council</span> in confidence that he and certain others would go as ambassadors to Lacedaemon to explain the matter of the wall to the Lacedaemonians; and he instructed the magistrates <span class="note" id="Note4"> [the <span class="term">archons</span>, <span class="foreign">τοῖς δὲ ἄρχουσι</span>]</span>, when ambassadors should come from Lacedaemon to Athens, to detain them until he himself should return from Lacedaemon, and in the meantime to put the whole population to work fortifying the city. In this manner, he declared to them, they would achieve their purpose.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.39.5</span>).</div>

<p>This function of the <span class="term">Council</span>, as a body that was democratic, like the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, but also able to keep secrets, because of its smaller size and indoor meetings, appears in another anecdote from Diodorus. Here, Themistocles has plans to fortify the Piraeus, the harbor of Athens. We can see from the passage that the Athenians were worried not only about their (potential) enemies, the Lacedaimonians (another name for the Spartans), but about Themistocles’ own intentions; was he aiming to become tyrant? The Athenians wanted to know what Themistocles was up to, but did not want the whole world to know what Themistocles was up to. Diodorus describes the solution:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Now as Themistocles pondered these matters, he decided that he should not make public announcement of his plan, knowing with certainty that the Lacedaemonians would endeavour to stop it; and so he announced to the citizens in <span class="term">Assembly</span> that he wished both to advise upon and to introduce important matters which were also to the advantage of the city. But what these matters were, he added, it was not in the public interest to state openly, but it was fitting that a few men should be charged with putting them into effect; and he therefore asked the people to select two men in whom they had the greatest confidence and to entrust to them to pass upon the matter in question. The people acceded to his advice, and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> chose two men, Aristeides and Xanthippus, selecting them not only because of their upright character, but also because they saw that these men were in active rivalry with Themistocles for glory and leadership and were therefore opposed to him. These men heard privately from Themistocles about his plan and then declared to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> that what Themistocles had disclosed to them was of great importance, was to the advantage of the state, and was feasible. The people admired the man and at the same time harboured suspicions of him, lest it should be with the purpose of preparing some sort of tyranny for himself that he was embarking upon plans of such magnitude and importance, and they urged him to declare openly what he had decided upon. But he made the same reply, that it was not to the interests of the state that there should be a public disclosure of his intentions. Thereupon the people were far the more amazed at the man’s shrewdness and greatness of mind, and they urged him to disclose his ideas secretly to the <span class="term">Council</span>, assuring him that, if that body decided that what he said was feasible and advantageous, then they would advise it to carry his plan to completion. Consequently, when the <span class="term">Council</span> learned all the details and decided that what he said was for the advantage of the state and was feasible, the <span class="term">people</span>, without more ado, agreed with the <span class="term">Council</span>, and Themistocles received authority to do whatever he wished. And every man departed from the <span class="term">Assembly</span> in admiration of the high character of the man, being also elated in spirit and expectant of the outcome of the plan</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.42.1-6</span>).</div>

<p>In this instance, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> took two courses of action, one after another. First, it went along with Themistocles’ suggestion by appointing two citizens to confer with him privately and to report their opinion back to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. But the Athenians still seem to have been uneasy with the idea of acting on the recommendation of only two men. Instead, they took advantage of the nature of the <span class="term">Council</span>—it was fully democratic and included a number of citizens (500 in all, 50 sitting each month), but could also confer in private, away from potentially hostile ears.</p>

<p>Thucydides tells the story of how the Athenian Alcibiades manipulated the Athenians into forming an alliance with Argos by presenting certain information to the <span class="term">Council</span> and different information to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 5.45</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Nic.</span> 10.4-6</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Alc.</span> 14.4-6</span>).</p>

<div class="p">From a speech by the orator Antiphon, we see the <span class="term">Council</span> exercising a judicial function in the <span class="date">5th century BCE</span>. At <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Antiph. 6.35</span> the speaker says, <blockquote class="quote"><p>I was about to prosecute Aristion, Philinus, Ampelinus, and the secretary to the <span class="term">Thesmothetae</span> <span class="note" id="Note5"> [<span class="foreign">θεσμοθέτης</span>) was the name given to six of the nine <span class="term">archons</span>, with the other three being the ‘Archon’ (<span class="foreign">ἄρχων</span>), the ‘King Archon’ (<span class="foreign">βασιλεύς</span>), and the ‘Warlord’ (<span class="foreign">πολέμαρχος</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.1</span>)]</span>, with whose embezzlements they had been associated, on charges which I had presented to the <span class="term">Council</span> in the form of an <span class="term">impeachment</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">κατηγορήσειν ἔμελλον Ἀριστίωνος καὶ Φιλίνου καὶ Ἀμπελίνου καὶ τοῦ ὑπογραμματέως τῶν θεσμοθετῶν, μεθ᾽ οὗπερ συνέκλεπτον, περὶ ὧν εἰσήγγειλα εἰς τὴν βουλήν</span>). Shortly thereafter, he mentions that while serving on the <span class="term">Council</span> himself, he had brought charges (<span class="foreign">εἰσαγγελίαι</span>) against several public officials—the Public Purchasing Agents (<span class="foreign">πορισταί</span>), the Public Auctioneers (<span class="foreign">πωληταί</span>), the Bailiffs (<span class="foreign">πράκτορες</span>), and the clerks attached to them (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Antiph. 6.49</span>). On this occasion, he requested that the <span class="term">Council</span> conduct an investigation and get to the bottom of the matter (<span class="foreign">ὡς χρὴ ζητοῦντας ἐπεξελθεῖν τῷ πράγματι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Antiph. 6.49</span>). These cases both involve alleged misdeeds of public officials, hence the intervention of the <span class="term">Council</span>.</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="HistoryOligarchy411"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">The Oligarchic Coup of 411 BCE</span></h2>


<p>Thucydides and Aristotle also describe at length the oligarchic <span class="term">coup d’état</span> in <span class="date">411</span>, when the democracy was overthrown and replaced for a short time by an oligarchy. The role of the <span class="term">Council</span>, and changes to its composition and powers, played a prominent part in these events.</p>

<div class="p">This oligarchic coup began after the Athenian expedition against Sicily ended in disaster in <span class="date">413</span> (these events are described in <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 6-7</span>). After news of the defeat came to Athens, the Athenians were certain that the Sicilians would send a fleet to invade Attica (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.1.2</span>). Thucydides describes Athens’ response to this crisis: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Nevertheless, with such means as they had, it was determined to resist to the last, and to provide timber and money, and to equip a fleet as they best could, to take steps to secure their confederates and above all Euboea, to reform things in the city upon a more economical footing, and to elect a board of elders to act as preliminary advisers regarding the state of affairs as occasion should arise. In short, as is the way of a democracy, in the panic of the moment they were ready to be as prudent as possible.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.1.3-4</span>).</div>

<div class="p">This ‘board of elders’ (<span class="foreign">ἀρχήν τινα πρεσβυτέρων ἀνδρῶν</span>) were <span class="quote_inline">to be preliminary councillors</span> (<span class="foreign">προβουλεύσουσιν</span>) to Athens. Aristotle, in his work on politics, has an interesting and relevant discussion of Councils (<span class="foreign">βουλαί</span>) and Boards of Preliminary Councillors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1299b</span>): <blockquote class="quote"><p>But there are also some offices peculiar to special forms of constitution, for instance the office of Preliminary Councillors. This is undemocratic, although a Council is a popular body, for there is bound to be some body of this nature to have the duty of preparing measures for the popular assembly, in order that it may be able to attend to its business; but a preparatory committee, if small, is oligarchical, and Preliminary Councillors must necessarily be few in number, so that they are an oligarchical element. But where both of these magistracies exist, the Preliminary Councillors are in authority over the Councillors, since a councillor is a democratic official, but a preliminary councillor is an oligarchic one. Also the power of the Council is weakened in democracies of the sort in which the people in assembly deals with everything itself.</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="p">So, according to Aristotle’s understanding of politics in Greek cities, the addition of a board of ‘probouloi,’ Preliminary Councillors, was an move away from democracy and toward oligarchy. Returning to Thucydides, then, it seems from his comment that in this crisis Athens was <span class="quote_inline">ready to be as prudent as possible</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.1.4</span>) suggests that, in the historian’s eyes, less democracy equalled greater prudence.</div>

<p>The only evidence that we have for the powers of these Preliminary Councillors is a scene from Aristophanes’ <span class="titlem">Lysistrata</span>, and since this is a comic play, it is not the most reliable historical evidence. Nevertheless, it is interesting. In this play, produced and performed for an Athenian audience in <span class="date">411 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>), there is a character who is one of the Preliminary Councillors (<span class="foreign">πρόβουλος</span>). We see him, in one scene, going up to the Acropolis to get some public funds to purchase supplies for the navy (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Lys.</span> 420-423</span>). In another scene he orders the <span class="term">Scythian Archers</span> (<span class="foreign">τοχόται</span>) to arrest someone (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Lys.</span> 430-466</span>). Still elsewhere, he orders a herald to arrange for the Spartans to send ambassadors to Athens, and says that he himself will order the <span class="term">Council</span> to appoint Athenian ambassadors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Lys.</span> 590-610</span>). If this portrayal of a Preliminary Councillor is at all based on the reality of Athens in <span class="date">411 BCE</span>, it suggests that the Preliminary Councillors had taken over many of the responsibilities formerly belonging to the <span class="term">Council</span>: funding the navy, enforcing order, arranging ambassadors.</p>


<p>The events of the year <span class="date">411 BCE</span> support Aristotle’s assertion that, while the <span class="term">Council</span> was a democratic institution, these Preliminary Councillors leaned toward oligarchy (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). These men, the Probouloi (<span class="foreign">προβοῦλοι</span>), seem to have been instrumental in establishing the so-called ‘Oligarchy of 400’ (<span class="foreign">οἱ τετρακόσιοι</span>); we have an anecdote in Aristotle’s <span class="titlem">Rhetoric</span> in which a certain Sophocles, one of the Preliminary Councillors appointed in <span class="date">413</span>, admitted to overthrowing the democracy (note that Aristotle is interested in rhetoric here, not history):</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>If a conclusion is put in the form of a question, we should state the reason for our answer. For instance, Sophocles being asked by Pisander whether he, like the rest of the Preliminary Councillors (<span class="foreign">τοῖς ἄλλοις προβούλοις</span>), had approved the setting up of the Four Hundred, he admitted it. <span class="quote_inline">What then?</span> asked Pisander, <span class="quote_inline">did not this appear to you to be a wicked thing?</span> Sophocles admitted it. <span class="quote_inline">So then you did what was wicked?</span> <span class="quote_inline">Yes, for there was nothing better to be done.</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Rh.</span> 1419a</span>)</div>

<div class="p">Also, the orator Lysias describes how Theramenes was a leading proponent of the oligarchy in <span class="date">411</span>, <span class="quote_inline">And also his father, being one of the Preliminary Councillors, was active in this business</span> (<span class="foreign">καὶ ὁ μὲν πατὴρ αὐτοῦ τῶν προβούλων ὢν ταὔτ᾽ ἔπραττεν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 12.65</span>).</div>

<p>The Athenians brought an end to their democracy and instituted an oligarchy by, first, appointing ten ‘Commissioners’ (<span class="foreign">συγγραφεῖς</span>) who were charged with re-writing the constitution of Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.67.1</span>). Aristotle says that there were twenty of these, and that they were in addition to the ten Preliminary Councillors already in office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 29.2</span>).</p>

<div class="p">This is not the place to give all the details of the reforms that the oligarchs put in place after the coup of <span class="date">411 BCE</span>. For our purposes, it is enough to note that these Commissioners proposed a new <span class="term">Council</span>, consisting of 400 men; there would be no more stipends, which allowed poorer citizens to serve in public offices; five men would be chosen as ‘Presidents’ (<span class="foreign">προέδροι</span>); these would each choose 100 men for the <span class="term">Council</span>, and each of those 100 would choose three others, thus creating the Council of 400 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.67.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 29.5</span>). This new government claimed that a Council of 400 was <span class="quote_inline">according to the ancestral constitution</span> (<span class="foreign">κατὰ τὰ πάτρια</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 31.1</span>). This Council of 400 would have the power to choose 5000 Athenians who would be the only citizens eligible to participate in assemblies (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.67.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 29.5</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Thucydides describes how this new Council of 400 collected an armed gang, confronted the <span class="quote_inline">Councillors who had been chosen by lot</span> (<span class="foreign">τοῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ κυάμου?βουλευταῖς</span>), that is, the democratic <span class="term">Council</span>, paid them their stipends, and send them home (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.69.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 32.1</span>).</div>

<div class="p">What is significant for our understanding of the role of the Council is that, according to both Aristotle and Thucydides, democracy at Athens came to an end when the democratic <span class="term">Council</span> (the one chosen by lot) was dissolved (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.69.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 32.1-2</span>). It is also significant that this oligarchy seems to have been put in place—the Preliminary Councillors and Commissioners appointed, stipends ended, the democratic <span class="term">Council</span> dissolved—with the cooperation, or at least without opposition, from the democratic <span class="term">Assembly</span>. Thucydides says that the democratic <span class="term">Assembly</span> cooperated in its own destruction: <span class="quote_inline">…the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, when it had ratified these other things, with no one speaking against them, was dissolved</span> (…<span class="foreign">ἡ ἐκκλησία οὐδενὸς ἀντειπόντος, ἀλλὰ κυρώσασα ταῦτα διελύθη</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.69.1</span>). Aristotle says that the new constitution was ratified <span class="quote_inline">by the masses</span> (<span class="foreign">ὑπὸ τοῦ πλήθους</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 32.1</span>).</div>

<p>There is an interesting contrast, with the <span class="term">Assembly</span> cooperating in creating a limited, oligarchic government (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.69.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 32.1</span>), but the <span class="term">Council</span> having to be evicted by an armed gang (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.69.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 32.1</span>). This contrast brings to mind Solon, who, according to Plutarch, established the <span class="term">Council</span> to prevent the People from damaging the constitution (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.1-2</span>).</p>
</div>



<div class="Section" id="HistoryBetween"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">Between Oligarchy and Tyranny</span></h2>


<div class="p">This oligarchic government lasted only four months before it was replaced by another government in which the power was in the hands of 5000 Athenians—more democratic, but still a far cry from the radical democracy defined by Cleisthenes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 33.1</span>). That government, in turn, lasted only a short time before <span class="quote_inline">the People quickly seized control of the constitution from them</span> (<span class="foreign">τούτους μὲν οὖν ἀφείλετο τὴν πολιτείαν ὁ δῆμος διὰ τάξους</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 34.1</span>).</div>

<div class="p">A speech by Andocides quotes the first decree issued by the restored democracy, in <span class="date">410 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>): <blockquote class="quote"><p>Enacted by the <span class="term">Council</span> and <span class="term">People</span>. Prytany of the tribe Aeantis. Secretary: Cleigenes. President: Boethus. The enactment following was framed by Demophantus and his colleagues. The date of this decree is the first sitting of the <span class="term">Council</span> of Five Hundred, chosen by lot, at which Cleigenes acted as Secretary. If anyone shall suppress the democracy at Athens or hold public office after its suppression, he shall become a public enemy and be slain with impunity; his goods shall be confiscated and a tithe given to the Goddess <span class="note" id="Note6"> [i.e. Athene]</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.96</span>). Again, we should note that this decree defines the restoration of the Democracy in terms of the <span class="term">Council</span>: <span class="quote_inline">the first sitting of the <span class="term">Council</span> of Five Hundred, chosen by lot</span> (<span class="foreign">ἄρχει χρόνος τοῦδε τοῦ ψηφίσματος ἡ βουλὴ οἱ πεντακόσιοι οἱ λαχόντες τῷ κυάμῳ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.96</span>).</div>

<p>Once the oligarchy had been overthrown in <span class="date">410 BCE</span>, the restored democratic government immediately set up a body of ‘Law Publishers’ (<span class="foreign">ἀναγραφεῖς τῶν νόμων</span>) to publish all of the laws, especially those of Draco and Solon (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 104.5-6</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.25</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, <span class="titlem">Athenian Democracy,</span> 162-3</span>). Nicomachus was in charge of this board, as ‘Commissioner of Laws’ (<span class="foreign">τῶν νόμων ἀναγραφεὺς</span>), and was originally supposed to complete publication in four months (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.2</span>). The board spent six years, however, compiling and publishing Solon’s body of laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.2-3</span>). The published laws, which included the homicide law of Draco and laws regarding the powers of the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="bibl">ML 86</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 105</span>) were inscribed on the wall of the Stoa Basileios in the Agora (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.2-3</span>).</p>

<p>In <span class="date">406 BCE</span>, the Athenians won a naval victory over the Spartans near the Arginousae islands in the Aegean—the battle is described at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.6.24-35</span> and (quite differently) at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 13.76-79</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 13.97-100</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OHCW</span></span>). After the battle, the Athenians launched an effort to rescue their men from some disabled ships, but a storm prevented the rescue. This battle and the failed rescue attempt set the stage for a famous miscarriage of justice on the part of the Athenian democracy, in which the <span class="term">Council</span> played an important role.</p>

<p>Of the eight generals who had taken part in the battle, only six returned to Athens, and these were six made statements about the battle in front of the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.1-3</span>). Timocrates proposed to the <span class="term">Council</span> that they should be imprisoned and tried by the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, whereupon a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was called (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.3-4</span>). Xenophon says that the generals had written a letter to both the <span class="term">Council</span> and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> blaming the storm for their failure to rescue the sailors, and a certain Theramenes held this up as evidence that the generals, alone, were to blame (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.4</span>). Xenophon goes on to note that Theramenes had been present at the battle and had, in fact, been given the job of rescuing the men (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.5</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Each of generals gave a speech in his own defense at this meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, but Xenophon says that <span class="quote_inline">These speeches were short, since they were not allowed to speak for the length of time permitted by law</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.5</span>). Despite some public sympathy for the generals, the Athenians decided <blockquote class="quote"><p>that the matter should be postponed to another meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (for by that time it was late in the day and they could not have distinguished the hands in the voting), and that the <span class="term">Council</span> should draft and bring in a proposal regarding the manner in which the men should be tried.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.7</span>).</div>

<div class="p">According to Xenophon, Theramenes and the others opposed to the generals bribed a man named Callixeinus, who was serving on the <span class="term">Council</span> at the time (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.9</span>) to testify against the generals when the <span class="term">Council</span> met next (the festival of the Apaturia caused a delay of several days between the first <span class="term">Assembly</span> and the next meeting of the <span class="term">Council</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.8-9</span>). When the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was convened, the <span class="term">Council</span> brought to it a proposal (<span class="foreign">γνώμην</span>) written by Callixeinus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.9</span>). The proposal stated that there would be no more speeches on the matter of the generals, but that the <span class="term">Assembly</span> would go straight to a vote; the voting would be by by tribes, using pebbled dropped in urns (<span class="foreign">διαψηφίσασθαι Ἀθηναίους ἅπαντας κατὰ φυλάς</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.9</span>). The question on which they would vote, as Xenophon reports it, was loaded: <span class="quote_inline">[Did] the generals seem guilty of not picking up the men who had won the naval battle?</span> (<span class="foreign">δοκοῦσιν ἀδικεῖν οἱ στρατηγοὶ οὐκ ἀνελόμενοι τοὺς νικήσαντας ἐν τῇ ναυμαχίᾳ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.9</span>). The generals had admitted as much, but claimed that the storm made it impossible. If the generals were found to be guilty by the voting, the proposal said, they would be put to death by the <span class="term">Eleven</span>, and their property would be confiscated to the state, with one tenth of it going to the treasury of Athene (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.10</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Euryptolemus and a few others then issued a charge of ‘illegal proposal’ (<span class="foreign">παράνομα φάσκοντες συγγεγραφέναι</span>) against Callixeinus, a procedure designed to prevent the <span class="term">Assembly</span> from violating the law (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.12</span>). In a speech, as reported by Xenophon, Euryptolemus explained in what way this proposal was illegal, when he asks his fellow Athenians: <blockquote class="quote"><p>What is it, pray, that you fear, that you are in such excessive haste? Do you fear lest you will lose the right to put to death and set free anyone you please if you proceed in accordance with the law, but think that you will retain this right if you proceed in violation of the law, by the method which Callixeinus persuaded the <span class="term">Council</span> to report to the people, that is, by a single vote?</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.26</span>). If the Athenians want to put the generals on trial they may, Euryptolemus says, but by the legal procedure: <blockquote class="quote"><p>let the men be tried, each one separately, and let the day be divided into three parts, one wherein you shall gather and vote as to whether you judge them guilty or not, another wherein the accusers shall present their case, and another wherein the accused shall make their defence</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.23</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Xenophon says that <blockquote class="quote"><p>some of the People clearly favored this, but the majority shouted that it was a terrible thing is anyone should not let the People do whatever they wanted</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">τοῦ δὲ δήμου ἔνιοι ταῦτα ἐπῄνουν, τὸ δὲ πλῆθος ἐβόα δεινὸν εἶναι εἰ μή τις ἐάσει τὸν δῆμον πράττειν ὃ ἂν βούληται</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.13</span>). Euryptolemus and the others, fearing that they would be put on trial as well, withdrew their charge (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.13</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The proposal of Callixeinus almost failed to come to a vote, becuase the members of the <span class="term">Council</span> who were serving as Prytanes (<span class="foreign">τῶν δὲ πρυτάνεών τινων</span>) said that they would not allow it, since the <span class="quote_inline">vote was illegal</span> (<span class="foreign">τὴν διαψήφισιν παρὰ τὸν νόμον</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.14</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Xenophon continues his account: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Then the Prytanes, stricken with fear, agreed to put the question—all of them except Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus; and he said that in no case would he act except in accordance with the law</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.15</span>). This Socrates was the famous philosopher, and according to other ancient sources he was not only serving as one of the Prytanes of the <span class="term">Council</span> during these events, but was Epistates, ‘President’ on this day. Xenophon’s <span class="titlem">Memorabilia</span>, he says that Socrates <blockquote class="quote"><p>was on the <span class="term">Council</span> and had taken the counsellor’s oath by which he bound himself to give counsel in accordance with the laws, it fell to his lot to preside in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> when the people wanted to condemn Thrasyllus and Erasinides and their colleagues to death by a single vote. That was illegal, and he refused the motion in spite of popular rancour and the threats of many powerful persons</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 1.1.18</span>; see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Gorg.</span> 473e</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Apol.</span> 32b</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 4.4.2</span>).</div>

<div class="p">In Plato’s <span class="titlem">Gorgias</span>, Socrates himself describes these events to Polus with a certain amount of dark humor (the context is a discussion of how it is better to suffer injustice than to commit it): <blockquote class="quote"><p>Polus, I am not one of your statesmen: indeed, last year, when I was elected a member of the <span class="term">Council</span>, and, as my tribe held the Presidency, I had to put a question to the vote, I got laughed at for not understanding the procedure</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Gorg.</span> 463e</span>); by <span class="quote_inline">not understanding the procedure,</span> Socrates is referring to the illegal procedure of trying all the generals with a single vote, and with no opportunity for them to defend themselves.</div>

<div class="p">Despite the refusal of Socrates the Epistates to allow the vote, the procedure continued in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, with Euryptolemus giving a speech on behalf of the generals (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.16-33</span>) and putting forward a motion that <span class="quote_inline">the men should each be given a separate trial in accordance with the decree of Cannonus</span> (<span class="foreign">κατὰ τὸ Καννωνοῦ ψήφισμα κρίνεσθαι τοὺς ἄνδρας δίχα ἕκαστον</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.34</span>); the decree of Cannonus was the law that governed the trial and punishment of anyone who did harm to the people of Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.20</span>). The <span class="term">Assembly</span> voted in favor of the <span class="term">Council</span>’s original proposal, voted once on the guilt of all eight generals, and the six generals who were in Athens were put to death (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.34</span>; for a more condensed version of these events, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 13.101.1-7</span>).</div>

<div class="p">In this case, the <span class="term">Council</span> clearly failed in its function as a check on the vicissitudes of the larger <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The Athenians themselves realized this, according to Xenophon, who says: <blockquote class="quote"><p>And not long afterwards the Athenians repented, and they voted that complaints (<span class="foreign">προβολαί</span>) be brought against any who had deceived the people, that they provide men to stand as guarantors until such time as they should be brought to trial, and that Callixeinus be included among them</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.35</span>; ‘probolai’ were complaints against someone who has allegedly harmed the state and were heard before the <span class="term">Assembly</span>; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.193</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.145</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 15.314</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.5</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 59.2</span>). How did the trial of the generals continue after the epistates refused to allow the vote?</div>

<p>There are two possibilities, with no obvious reason to prefer one over the other. First, we might note that Xenophon’s account of events includes several clear examples of improper procedure: the generals were not allowed to speak in their own defense for the proper amount of time (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.5</span>); Callixeinus is said to have been bribed to author the <span class="term">Council</span>’s proposal (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.8-9</span>); his proposal (<span class="foreign">γνώμη</span>) was itself illegal (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.9-10</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.26</span>); Euryptolemus and the others were intimidated into withdrawing their charge of ‘illegal proposal,’ rather than letting it come to a vote (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.13</span>). Given these irregularities, we could easily imagine that the <span class="term">Assembly</span> simply went ahead with a vote on the guilt of the generals, without the sanction of Socrates the epistates.</p>

<div class="p">The second possibility is this: Xenophon tells us at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.15</span> that Socrates alone refused to acceed to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>’s wishes. He then says (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.16</span>) that <span class="quote_inline">after these things</span> (<span class="foreign">μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα</span>) Euryptolemus gave a speech (which he quotes), and there was the vote. It is possible that Xenophon’s phrase <span class="quote_inline">after these things</span> is speaking of a delay from one day to the next. On the next day someone else would have been serving as Epistates, since each Epistates served for one day and one night (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.1</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The affair of the Arginousae Generals shows us why the Athenians gave the <span class="term">Council</span> the authority it had over the <span class="term">Assembly</span>—even though in this case the <span class="term">Council</span> failed in that role. This affair also shows us an unfortunate side effect of the restoration of democracy after the oligarchic coup of <span class="date">411</span>. During the proceedings against the generals, the Athenian people gathered in <span class="term">Assembly</span> cried out <span class="quote_inline">that it was a terrible thing is anyone should not let the People do whatever they wanted</span> (<span class="foreign">τὸ δὲ πλῆθος ἐβόα δεινὸν εἶναι εἰ μή τις ἐάσει τὸν δῆμον πράττειν ὃ ἂν βούληται</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.13</span>). Reacting against the recent oligarchy, the newly restored democracy wanted no limits on its right to act. Only later, when it was too late, did the Athenians realize that they had been mistaken in assuming that an <span class="term">Assembly</span>, acting without regard to the law and without the calming authority of a democratic <span class="term">Council</span>, could ensure justice (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.35</span>).</div>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="HistoryThirty"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">The Tyranny of the Thirty</span></h2>


<p>In <span class="date">404 BCE</span>, when Athens surrended to Sparta, the government of the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span>, imposed on Athens by the Spartans, removed these published laws from the Stoa Basileios (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.2-3</span>). Nicomachus, the head of the ‘Law Publishers’ was later put on trial, accused of manipulating the laws he published and helping the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span> consolidate their power (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.1-3</span>).</p>

<div class="p">Like the Oligarchy of <span class="date">411</span>, the tyranny of the <span class="term">Thirty</span> lasted only one year, and after it was overthrown and the city returned to democratic rule, Athens once again compiled and codified its old laws: <blockquote class="quote"><p>On the motion of Teisamenus the <span class="term">People</span> decreed that Athens be governed as of old, in accordance with the laws of Solon, his weights and his measures, and in accordance with the statutes of Draco, which we used in times past.

<p>An inscription, <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> I3 105</span>, survives that records a law limiting the <span class="term">Council</span>’s authority. After two anti-democratic revolutions, this law says that in matters of war and peace, death sentences, large fines, disenfranchisement (that is, loss of <span class="term">citizenship</span>), the administration of public finances, and foreign policy the <span class="term">Council</span> cannot act without the approval of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>.</p>

<p>Even with these careful restrictions to its authority the <span class="term">Council</span> was a central institution in the restoration of the government, as the Athenians reestablished their democracy following an oligarchic coup and a tyranny imposed by a conquoring state. We can see that the <span class="term">Council</span>, by establishing lawmakers (<span class="foreign">νομόθεται</span>), by supervising their work, and by ratifying their laws according to their oath, was the central institution in defining the democracy as it would exist in the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>.</p>
