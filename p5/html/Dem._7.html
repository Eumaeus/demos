<p>(Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">On Halonnesus</span>, see also Oratory). This speech is somewhat controversial. The ancient commentator Dionysius of Halicarnassus calls it the <span class="titlem">Eighth Philippic</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dion. Hal. <span class="titlem">Ad Amm.</span> 10.33</span>; see also, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 4</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 6</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 9</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 10</span>, the <span class="titlem">Philippics</span>). But Libanius, another ancient commentator, says that this speech is not actually by Demosthenes, but by Hegesippus, based on its style and subject matter (<span class="bibl">Lib. Or. 7.6-8</span>; unfortunately, no other speech by Hegesippus survive, so we cannot compare the styles for ourselves). The relevant texts from Dionysius and Libanius are given below. The background to the speech is this: Shortly after <span class="date">346 BCE</span>, Halonnesus, an island in the Aegean that belonged to Athens, was captured by a pirate named Sostratus. Philip of Macedon defeated this pirate and took over control of the island himself. In <span class="date">343 BCE</span> Athens sent an embassy to Philip to demand that he return Halonnesus to its rightful owner, Athens. One of the ambassadors from Athens was Hegesippus. Philip offered, not to return the island to Athens, but to give it as a gift. This speech, probably written by Demosthenes, but certainly not delivered by him — the speaker says that he was a member of the embassy to Philip, which Demosthenes was not (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 7.2</span>) — was probably delivered before the <span class="term">Assembly</span> in <span class="date">342 BCE</span>.</p>
<div class="p">On the subject of <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 7</span>, Dionysius of Halicarnassus says (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dion. Hal. <span class="titlem">Ad Amm.</span> 10.33</span>): <blockquote class="quote"><p>After Lykiskon was <span class="term">archon</span>, Pythodotos was <span class="term">archon</span>, in the year when the eighth of the speeches against Philip was composed, the beginning of which is ‘O men of Athens, there is no way that the charges…’</p></blockquote> (compare <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 7.1</span>) (<blockquote class="quote"><p>μετὰ Λυκίσκον ἔστιν ἄρχων Πυθόδοτος, ἐφ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??οὗ ὀγδόην τῶν Φιλιππικῶν δημηγοριῶν διέθετο πρὸς τοὺς Φιλίππου πρέσβεις, ἧς ἐστιν ἀρχή Ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, οὐκ ἔστιν, ὅπως αἱ αἰτίαι</p></blockquote>…). But Libanius says (<span class="bibl">Lib. 7.6-7</span>): <div class="cit"><div class="citbibl"></div><div class="citquote">Yes, by Zeus, but the speech on the Halonnesus advises the Athenians not to take it, but to take it back and it makes a distinction between the words, and regarding these matters, Aeschines says that Demosthenes advised the Athenians. Then what’s this? For it is possible for this advice to have been given by Demosthenes or Hegesippus, since in other respects they held the same view and they opposed those orators who were taking Philip's side, and Demosthenes mentions that Hegesippus, when he was an ambassador with Demosthenes and also opposed the Macedonian. And so it is clear that the speech that Demosthenes wrote regarding the Halonnesus does not survive, but with that speech not in existence, they attributed the one they found to him, having as an excuse the fact that the orator did give a speech on the Halonnesus, never examining closely whether, in fact, it seems likely to have been by him.</div></div> (<div class="cit"><div class="citbibl"></div><div class="citquote">Νὴ Δία, ἀλλ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ὁ λόγος συμβουλεύει περὶ τῆς Ἁλοννήσου τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις μὴ λαμβάνειν αὐτήν, ἀλλὰ ἀπολαμβάνειν καὶ διαφέρεται περὶ τῶν ὀνομάτων, ταῦτα δὲ Αἰσχίνης φησὶ τὸν Δημοσθένην συμβεβουλευκέναι τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις. εἶτα τί τοῦτο? δύναται γὰρ τὴν αὐτὴν πεποιῆσθαι συμβουλὴν καὶ Δημοσθένης καὶ Ἡγήσιππος, ἐπεὶ καὶ τἄλλα τῆς αὐτῆς ἦσαν ἐν τῇ πολιτείᾳ προαιρέσεως καὶ τοῖς φιλιππίζουσι τῶν ῥητόρων ἀντέλεγον, καὶ μέμνηται καὶ ὁ Δημοσθένης τοῦ Ἡγησίππου ὡς καὶ πρεσβεύσαντος μεθ?Ξλοσε-θυοτε-ς??ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἀντιταχθέντος τῷ Μακεδόνι. δῆλον οὖν ὅτι ὁ μὲν τοῦ Δημοσθένους λόγος ὁ περὶ τῆς Ἁλοννήσου ῥηθεὶς οὐ σώζεται, ἐκείνου δὲ οὐκ ὄντος τὸν εὑρεθέντα προσέθεσαν αὐτῷ ἀφορμὴν ἔχοντες τὸ περὶ Ἁλοννήσου λόγον εἰρῆσθαι τῷ ῥήτορι, οὐκέτι δὲ ἐξετάζοντες εἰ τοῦτον εἰκὸς εἶναι τὸν ἐκείνου.</div></div>) </div>
