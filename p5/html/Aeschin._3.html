<p>(Aeschines, <span class="titlem">Against Ctesiphon</span>, see also Oratory). This is a speech that Aeschines composed and delivered in a trial before a <span class="term">jury</span>. Philip of Macedon defeated Athens at the battle of Chaeronea in <span class="date">338 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). Afterwards, the city worked to improve its fortifications, fearing further trouble with Macedonia. The orator Demosthenes was entrusted with managing the fortifications of the Piraeus, Athens' main port, and he even contributed his own money to the project. Because of this, his friend Ctesiphon made a motion in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> that Demosthenes be awarded a crown, which was to be given him in the Theater of Dionysus. Aeschines, a long-time political rival of Demosthenes, brought charges against Ctesiphon, arguing that this motion was illegal (see Assembly for discussion of the legal issues). The trial came before a <span class="term">jury</span> in <span class="date">330 BCE</span> (source: <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). This speech is Aeschines' prosecution of Ctesiphon for moving an illegal motion, but the real issue in the speech is whether Demosthenes had served Athens well in previous years, or had led Athens to defeat at the hands of Philip. Demosthenes spoke in defense of Ctesiphon (and in the process attacked Aeschines' own service to Athens). Aeschines lost this case (source: <span class="bibl">C.D. Adams, <span class="titlem">The Speeches of Aeschines</span> [Harvard: Loeb Classical Library] 306-307</span>). (See also, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18</span>). </p>
