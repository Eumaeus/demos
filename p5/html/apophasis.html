    <p><span class="term">Apophasis</span> refers to an investigation into serious threats to the Athenian
     democracy, especially treason and bribery, although there is some evidence for it being used
     for lesser offenses. This investigation involved several branches of the Athenian government:
     the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>,
     and the <span class="term">People’s Court</span>. This procedure, an innovation of the
      <span class="date">later 4th century BCE</span>, began with an investigation
     conducted by the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, which would issue a report. The
     report was called an <span class="term">apophasis</span> (<span class="foreign">ἀπόφασις</span>).
     Eventually, the whole procedure—investigation, report, prosecution—came to be known by this
     term. When the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> issued its report on suspected
     treason or bribery, it included a recommendation, either to prosecute certain parties or not
     to. If the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> recommended prosecution, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> would appoint prosecutors, and the matter would be tried
     before the <span class="term">People’s Court</span>. The different institutions seem to
     have served to balance each other, and we hear of several cases in which the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> recommended conviction, but the <span class="term">Assembly</span> or <span class="term">People’s Court</span> acquitted the
     defendant.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="Introduction"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Introduction</span></h2>
    
    <div class="p"><span class="term">Apophasis</span> (<span class="foreign">ἀπόφασις</span>) refers to a report issued
     by the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> after the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> had investigated a matter of bribery or treason (see, for example, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.1</span>). But this report was
     merely one part of an involved process of investigation and prosecution that involved the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and the
      <span class="term">People’s Court</span>. The best evidence for this procedure comes
     from Dinarchus’ speech prosecuting Demosthenes for allegedly having taken bribes from Harpalus, a Macedonian (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din.
      1.1</span>). In this speech, Dinarchus concisely describes
     the procedure for an <span class="term">apophasis</span>, and describes how the different institutions of
     the Athenian government worked together. He begins by saying that, <span class="quote_inline">The council of the
       <span class="term">Areopagus</span> is bound, gentlemen, to follow one of two methods
      in making all its reports (<span class="foreign">τὰς ἀποφάσεις πάσας</span>)</span>
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.50</span>). He spends a
     couple of sentences criticizing Demosthenes, then returns to
     characterize the current procedings: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Compare the present case, where you have both a
      decree <span class="note" id="Note1"> [<span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span>, passed by the <span class="term">Assembly</span>]</span> which
      authorized the <span class="term">council</span>’s inquiry <span class="note" id="Note2"> [the ‘
        <span class="term">council</span>
       ’ here is the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>]</span>, and
      accusers, elected by the <span class="term">people</span>
      <span class="note" id="Note3"> [<span class="foreign">χειροτονήσαντος τοῦ

      <span class="note" id="Note4"> [<span class="foreign">οἱ δικασταὶ</span>,
       in the <span class="term">People’s Court</span>]</span> an account of the crimes</p></blockquote>
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.51</span>).</div>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="FirstAppears"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Aphophasis First Appears in the later 4th century</span></h2>
    
    <div class="p">In a speech delivered in <span class="date">323 BCE</span>, Dinarchus refers to a decree, moved in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> by
      Demosthenes, that that <span class="term">Areopagus</span> should investigate a matter of bribery <span class="quote_inline">as was its traditional
      right</span> (<span class="foreign">ὡς αὐτῇ πάτριόν ἐστι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.4</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, 292</span>). But we do not have much other evidence that the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> regularly investigated matters of bribery. When Aristotle describes the <span class="term">Areopagus’</span> duties in the <span class="date">4th century</span>, he says
     that, <span class="quote_inline">Trials for deliberate murder and wounding are held in the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, and for causing death by poison, and for arson</span>
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
       Pol.</span> 57.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
      23.22</span>).</div>
    <p>There is however some evidence for the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> issuing
     reports to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> apart from the procedure we call
      <span class="term">apophasis</span>. Sometime before <span class="date">343 BCE</span>, we hear of the
      <span class="term">Areopagus</span> reporting to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> on the matter of some dwellings on the Pnyx (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin.
     1.81</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Harris, <span class="titlem">Aeschines and Athenian
       Politics</span></span>).</p>
    <p>But this is not called an <span class="term">apophasis</span>, and does not seem to have been similar to
     the later procedure. In fact, none of the evidence from oratory before the <span class="date">second half of the 4th century</span>
     mention <span class="term">apophasis</span> (this includes the orators Andocides, Isaeus, Antiphon, Lysias, Isocrates, Lycurgus, and Aeschines). Demosthenes uses the term several times,
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.60</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 37.21</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 37.34</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.1</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.2</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.11</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.12</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.14</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.17</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.25</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.26</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.27</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.28</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.30</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.45</span>), but in each case he
     seems to use the word generically, ‘an account’, such as someone might give
     when returning from a voyage, or (often) when itemizing an estate so the inheritance can be
     settled.</p>
    <div class="p">In Demosthenes speech ‘On the Crown,’
     delivered in <span class="date">330 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
      <span class="titlem">OCD</span>
      3
     </span>), he mentions two events that might be the first instances of <span class="term">apophasis</span>,
     although he does not use the term. Demosthenes mentions a man
     named Antiphon (not the orator Antiphon) who had been exiled from Athens, and
     then apprehended at the port of the Piraeus; he was
     acquitted, either by the <span class="term">People’s Court</span> or by the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, but the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>
     investigated the matter and secured his conviction (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.133</span>). Then, Demosthenes describes how Aeschines, having been selected to be an ambassador by the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, was investigated by the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, which
      <span class="quote_inline">rejected him as a traitor</span> (<span class="foreign">ἀπήλασεν ὡς
      προδότην</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
      18.134</span>). There is some reason to think that these might be the first attested instances
     of the procedure we call <span class="term">apophasis</span>. Dinarchus,
     in a speech seven years later, mentions the case of Antiphon and
     says that he was tortured and killed as a result of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>’ <span class="term">apophasis</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐστρέβλωσαν Ἀντιφῶντα καὶ
      ἀπέκτειναν οὗτοι τῇ τῆς βουλῆς ἀποφάσει πεισθέντες</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.63</span>). He then says that
      Demosthenes himself had been instrumental in giving this
     authority to the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, citing the cases not only of Antiphon, but also of a descendant of the hero Aristogiton, and a man named Charinus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.63</span>). So we can conclude
     that the procedure probably came into existence before <span class="date">330</span>, and came
     to be referred to as <span class="term">apophasis</span> before <span class="date">323 BCE</span> (source
     for dates: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen, 292</span>).</div>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="Treason"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head"><span class="term">Apophasis</span> invoked for cases of treason, bribery, and attempts to overthrow
     the democracy, but also for lesser crimes</span></h2>
    
    <div class="p">In Dinarchus’ speech against Demosthenes, part of an <span class="term">apophasis</span>, the orator’s rhetoric suggests that
     the trial was about more than bribery (the actual accusation; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.1</span>), but was about the
     security of the Athenian democracy. Dinarchus says that
     anyone who would defend Demosthenes is an enemy of Athens: <blockquote class="quote"><p>And whenever anyone comes forward to speak for him,
      bear in mind that he who does so, even if not involved in the reports [<span class="foreign">ἀποφάσεσιν</span>] we are about to hear, is hostile to the constitution, unwilling to see
      punished those who take bribes against the <span class="term">people</span> and anxious
      that the general protection of your persons, for which the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> is responsible, should be abolished and every right in the city
      overwhelmed</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din.
      1.112</span>). According to Dinarchus, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> investigated the question of bribery because any case of
     Macedonians bribing prominent Athenians would put the city in danger (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.3-4</span>).</div>
    <p><span class="term">Apophasis</span> was also used in cases when the city itself was thought to be in
     danger from some external enemy. Antiphon was the subject of
      <span class="term">apophasis</span> because, after being exiled as a spy and saboteur for the Macedonians,
     he was caught back in Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.132</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.63</span>). A man named Polyeuctus of Cydantidae was the
     subject of an <span class="term">apophasis</span> because he had made suspicious trips to Megara (although he was cleared of all suspicion when it was
     discovered that he had relatives there) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.58</span>). And Charinus was exiled, after an
      <span class="term">apophasis</span>, on a charge of treason (<span class="foreign">ἐπὶ
     προδοσίᾳ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din.
      1.63</span>).</p>
    <p>In a brief passage, however, Dinarchus mentions some lesser
     offenses that were first brought before the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> and then
     referred to a <span class="term">jury</span>—a defendant who robbed the captain of a
     ferry-boat, someone fraudulently collecting five drachmas (a public subsidy for attending the
      <span class="term">theater</span>), and a member of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> who was given a portion of meat from a public sacrifice
     (a benefit of service on the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>) who sold the portion
     illegally (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.56</span>). </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="Procedure"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">The Procedure</span></h2>
    
    <div class="p">Dinarchus says that either the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> or the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could initiate an
      <span class="term">apophasis</span>: <blockquote class="quote"><p>The council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>
      is bound, gentlemen, to follow one of two methods in making all its reports (<span class="foreign">τὰς ἀποφάσεις</span>). What are these methods? Its inquiry is made either
      on its own initiative or in obedience to the <span class="term">people</span>’s
      instructions</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din.
      1.50</span>). In at least one case, that of Antiphon, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> initiated an <span class="term">apophasis</span> after the man had
     been acquitted by the <span class="term">people</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.133</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.63</span>). In the trial of Demosthenes, the <span class="term">People</span> (<span class="foreign">ὁ δῆμος</span>) passed a decree asking the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> to investigate the question of bribery and to issue an
      <span class="term">apophasis</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din.
      1.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.7</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.58</span>); because <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.4</span> mentions <span class="quote_inline">the <span class="term">People</span> passing a lawful decree</span> (<span class="foreign">ψηφισαμένου γὰρ τοῦ δήμου δίκαιον ψήφισμα</span>), we can be sure that he is speaking of
     the <span class="term">Assembly</span>.</div>
    <div class="p">Once an <span class="term">apophasis</span> was begun, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>
     conducted an investigation. In a fragmentary speech by Hyperides, from the trial of Demosthenes, the orator
     says, <span class="quote_inline">The reporting of the names of the recipients <span class="note" id="Note5"> [of bribes]</span> it <span class="note" id="Note6"> [<span class="term">i.e.</span> the <span class="term">Assembly</span>]</span> assigned to the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, who gave these men’s names to the <span class="term">people</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hyp. 5.f9</span>; the text of this speech is badly damaged, and some parts have
     had to be reconstructed through inference, comparison with other sources, and educated
     guessing). Dinarchus says that Demosthenes himself had moved in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> that the
      <span class="term">Areopagus</span> investigate the question of bribery: <blockquote class="quote"><p>When,
      moreover, you, Demosthenes, and many others had proposed in
      a decree that the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, according to its traditional
      right, should hold an inquiry to discover if any of them had received gold from Harpalus, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> began its
      investigation (<span class="foreign">ζητεῖ</span>)</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.4</span>). Any subsequent action
     would then depend on the outcome of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>’ report
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.1</span>).</div>
    <div class="p">After the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> issued its report, the
      <span class="term">apophasis</span> itself, it could recommend that the defendant be tried before a <span class="term">jury</span>. Dinarchus describes the
     sequence of events: <blockquote class="quote"><p>In the case of Polyeuctus of Cydantidae, when the people instructed the Council of the
       <span class="term">Areopagus</span> to inquire whether he was accompanying the exiles
      to Megara and to report back after the investigation, it
      reported that he was doing so. You chose accusers as the law prescribes: Polyeuctus came into court and you acquitted him, on his admitting that he was going
      to Megara to Nicophanes who, he
      said, was married to his mother</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.58</span>). Here, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>
     reported that the man had gone to Megara with some exiles,
     and was thus suspected of treason. Because of this report, accusers were chosen to prosecute
     the case before a <span class="term">court</span>.</div>
    <div class="p">It seems that the <span class="term">Assembly</span> had to vote on whether to take a
     case to <span class="term">court</span> as a result of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>’ <span class="term">apophasis</span>. In a speech prosecuting Aristogiton, in a trial resulting from an <span class="term">apophasis</span> (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 2.1</span>), Dinarchus says of the defendant that <blockquote class="quote"><p>he has been found by
      the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> to have taken bribes against
      your interests… and the <span class="term">People</span> have, by a show of hands, handed
      him over to you <span class="note" id="Note7"> [the <span class="term">jury</span>]</span> to be punished</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">ὅτι τούτου κατέγνωκεν ἡ
      βουλὴ δῶρα λαμβάνειν καθ᾽ ὑμῶν</span>…<span class="foreign"> τούτου καταχειροτονήσας ὁ
      δῆμος παραδέδωκεν ὑμῖν τιμωρήσασθαι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 2.20</span>). At the same time that the <span class="term">Assembly</span> voted on whether to send a defendant to be tried in front of a <span class="term">jury</span>, it would also elect, by show of hands, one or more prosecuters
     to present the case against the defendant. Hyperides mentions
     chosen accusers (<span class="foreign">τοῖς ᾑρημένοις κατηγόροις</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hyp. 5.f9</span>). At <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.58</span>, the orator tells the
     people of Athens that <span class="quote_inline">you chose accusers as the law
      prescribes</span> (<span class="foreign">κατηγόρους εἵλεσθε κατὰ τὸν νόμον</span>); and
     at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.51</span> he mentions
      <span class="quote_inline">accusers, elected by the <span class="term">people</span>, who are now giving the
       <span class="term">jury</span> an account of the crimes</span> (<span class="foreign">καὶ κατήγοροι χειροτονήσαντος τοῦ δήμου, παρ᾽ ὧν νῦν οἱ δικασταὶ τἀδικήματα
      πυνθάνονται</span>).</div>
    <div class="p">It is clear that the ultimate decision—to punish the defendant or not to—was in the hands of
     the <span class="term">jury</span>. Dinarchus mentions
     many cases of defendants who were found guilty by the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>’ <span class="term">apophasis</span>, but subsequently acquitted by a <span class="term">jury</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.57-59</span>). Among them was Polyeuctus, whom the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> found to have made suspicious trips to Megara to visit some men who had been exiled from Athens. But, Dinarchus reminds the
     jury, <blockquote class="quote"><p>Polyeuctus came into <span class="term">court</span> and you acquitted him, on his admitting that he was going to Megara to Nicophanes who, he said, was
      married to his mother. So you did not consider that he was doing anything strange or
      reprehensible in keeping in touch with his mother’s husband who was in difficulties, or in
      assisting him, so far as he could, while he was banished from the country</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.58</span>).</div>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="Advantage"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">The advantage of a complex system of investigation</span></h2>
    
    <div class="p">The case of Polyeuctus illustrates the advantage of the complex
     procedure of investigation that came to be called <span class="term">apophasis</span>. By having the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> investigate the facts of a case, and a <span class="term">jury</span> decide on punishment, the Athenians considered themselves to
     have struck a balance between impersonal judgement and a more personal justice. Dinarchus says this explicitly. In his speech against Demosthenes, he explains why, in other cases, the <span class="term">jury</span> overrode the findings of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>: <blockquote class="quote"><p>There is an explanation for this which you will easily follow. The
      council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, gentlemen, has its own method of
      inquiring into the cases which you assign to it and the crimes committed within its own body.
      Unlike yourselves—and you need not take offence at this—who are sometimes apt when judging to
      give more weight to mercy than to justice, it simply reports anyone who is liable to the
      charges in question or has broken any traditional rule of conduct, believing that if a person
      is in the habit of committing small offences he will more easily involve himself in serious
      crimes</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din.
      1.54-55</span>). He mentions a few examples of people found guilty by the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, and then turned over to the <span class="term">jury</span>: <blockquote class="quote"><p>You tried these men and acquitted them. You were not thereby convicting
      the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> of error but you were more concerned with
      sympathy than justice, and thought the punishment too severe for the offence which the
      defendants had committed</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.56</span>). He concludes this explanation with the story of Polyeuctus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din.
      1.58</span>), which he sums up by saying: <blockquote class="quote"><p>The report of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>… was not proved false; it was quite true, but the <span class="term">jury</span> decided to acquit Polyeuctus. The council <span class="note" id="Note8"> [of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>]</span> was instructed to discover the truth, yet, as I say, the <span class="term">court</span> decided whether it was a case for pardon</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.59</span>).</div>
    <p>Dinarchus’s arguments are successful in suggesting that the
     procedure of <span class="term">apophasis</span>—which involved the less democratic institution of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> and the more democratic <span class="term">Assembly</span> and <span class="term">People’s Court</span>—was flexible and
     potentially fair.</p>
