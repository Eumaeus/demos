<p>Socrates of Athens is an enduring presence in the western imagination, in part because he presents us with a mass of contradictions: Most eloquent of men, yet he never wrote a word; ugliest yet most profoundly attractive; ignorant yet wise; wrongfully convicted, yet unwilling to avoid his unjust execution. Behind these conundrums is a contradiction less often explored: Socrates is at once the most Athenian, most ‘local,’ citizenly, patriotic, and other-regarding of philosophers—and yet the most cosmopolitan, critical, and self-regarding of Athenians. Exploring that contradiction, between ‘Socrates the loyal Athenian citizen’ and ‘Socrates the philosophical critic of Athenian society,’ will help to situate Plato’s Socrates in an Athenian legal and historical context; it allows us to reunite Socrates the literary character and Athens the democratic city that tried and executed him. And this will in turn go a ways in helping us to understand Plato’s presentation of the strange legal and ethical drama of ‘the last days of Socrates’—and thus Socrates’ remarkable impact on subsequent generations, in antiquity and modernity alike.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="setting"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Setting, Conventions, &amp; Expectations</span></h2>


<p>The setting of Plato’s <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> of Socrates is the public trial of <span class="date">399</span> B.C., in which Meletus (supported by other prominent Athenians), serving as a voluntary prosecutor, charged Socrates with impiety (including corruption of the youth). A jury of 500 citizens heard the case, presented as a timed speech of accusation by the prosecutor, followed by a defense speech of equal length by the accused. The jurors then voted by secret ballot and the votes were counted. Because a majority (280 to 220) judged Socrates guilty, each side delivered another speech, advocating a punishment. In these particulars, the trial followed established Athenian legal procedure. Plato’s <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> purports to be Socrates’ initial speech of defense, his second speech responding to the prosecutor’s call for his execution, and an informal post-sentencing address to those jurors who had voted in his favor. Socrates’ first speech conforms quite closely in form and style to other surviving examples of Athenian courtroom oratory, but its content is distinctive. While it is not possible to determine how accurate the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> is as record of how the historical Socrates actually defended himself on that day in <span class="date">399</span> B.C.; it is, I think, safe to claim that Plato’s text is an accurate record of Plato’s own first take on the problem of ‘Socrates and Athens’: Plato’s Socrates, the literary character, sketches out the case against himself and identifies his own bad reputation among the Athenian citizenry as the real issue in the case. He locates the ultimate source of this widespread and ultimately deadly resentment and distrust of himself in deeply ingrained Athenian assumptions and practices.</p>

<p>The 500 jurors who heard Socrates’ case were ordinary Athenian men, over age 30, who represented a reasonable cross section of citizen society. Most would have had to work for a living, a few might be genuinely destitute, a few others perhaps were of the leisure class. None was a legal ‘professional,’ but most of them were very experienced ‘consumers’ of public rhetoric, they were knowledgeable in the ways that Athenian public speakers attempted to persuade mass audiences through speech in courtroom and <span class="term">Assembly</span>. When he entered the courtroom, the typical Athenian juror already knew the elaborate unwritten rules of the game and expected the litigants to play by those rules.</p>

<p>There were well established rhetorical conventions to be observed; many jurors must have settled more comfortably into their seats when Socrates opened his defense with the standard gambit of claiming to be just a quiet private citizen, one who was unfamiliar with the courts, innocent of rhetorical training, and who now found himself confronted with skilled and experienced opponents (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">17a-d</span>). This commonplace (<span class="term">topos</span>), like others employed by Athenian litigants, served to establish the speaker’s loyal adherence to a generally accepted and specifically democratic code of belief and behavior. Along with explicit claims to having performed services for the <span class="term">polis</span> appropriate to one’s social station, rhetorical topoi sought to integrate the interests of the litigant-speaker and the audience of jurors.</p>

<p>The establishment of the speaker’s credentials as a useful citizen who conformed to standard democratic norms of belief and behavior would be interwoven with the substantive case establishing a defendant’s technical innocence. What the Athenian jury expected, then, was for the defendant, Socrates, to try to show through his rhetoric that the specific charges were without factual basis, and furthermore that they were incredible given his standing as a loyal citizen of the democratic polity. He should, moreover, explain how the baseless charges came to be lodged against him, in the process exposing his accusers as scoundrels who were corruptly willing, even viciously eager, to undermine democratic practices. Finally, he might try to show that his own behavior consistently conformed to a model of citizen dignity, while his opponents threatened the security of each citizen by brazenly violating public standards.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="apology"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Plato’s <span class="titlem">Apology</span></span></h2>


<div class="p">Plato’s <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> presents a Socrates who is very well aware of these rhetorical conventions and audience expectations (he had <span class="quote_inline">often</span> been present at trials of others: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">35a</span>) and more than willing to confound them. Socrates’ speech is a rhetorical masterpiece. But by its end he has not aligned himself with the democratic norms embraced by his fellow citizens. Instead, he has proved that his own political convictions are drastically at odds with popular views, and that his irritating, idiosyncratic everyday practice of examining his fellow Athenians (and finding them painfully wanting in wisdom), followed necessarily from his convictions. He has demonstrated that he is, by his own lights, a patriotic citizen who cares deeply about the good of his <span class="term">polis</span> and one who consistently acts in what he sees as his city’s best interests; but he has also shown also that, in light of his own definition of patriotism, Socrates must be regarded as a uniquely patriotic Athenian. Moreover, given the problematic current condition of the <span class="term">polis</span>, for Socrates <span class="quote_inline">doing good</span> means acting as a social critic: questioning fundamental Athenian beliefs in conversations held in public and private spaces of the city.</div>

<p>By the end of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span>, Socrates has shown (to his own satisfaction at least) that his accusers are fools, but fools appropriate to business as usual in the democratic state. He has established that he himself is a dignified private citizen rather than a pandering politician. But in the process he has also revealed that an active political life, one that included speaking out in the citizen <span class="term">Assembly</span>, is impossible for a just man. Finally he has shown that true dignity was not a social matter at all, but rather an affair of the individual soul.</p>

<p>In sum, Socrates’ position initially appears quite analogous to the position claimed by the standard Athenian politician: both Socrates and politicians claimed to be civic-minded activists who sought to improve the <span class="term">polis</span>. Yet ‘Socratic politics’ rejects trying to persuade mass audiences and Socratic ethics is a matter of private conscience rather than social control. These points will have been securely established for a sympathetic reader; but they would be regarded as arrogant and potentially subversive assertions by unsympathetic jurors who regarded persuasive public speeches and social control as essential bulwarks of the democratic order.</p>

<p>The defense speech centers on Socrates’ distinction between ‘new’ and ‘old’ accusers. This structuring technique can be read as a variation on the standard Athenian legal tactic of dealing with both the facts of the matter (the new) and with the defendant’s reputation among the citizens (the old). The standard approach was to show that the current charges against me are at variance with my reputation: The prosecutor says I have done something wrong, but my fellow citizens’ knowledge about me renders it impossible to believe that I did what he says. Thus you jurors must weigh my opponent’s lying words against my reputation and you should judge me accordingly. If there are nasty rumors about me floating around, these are the product of my opponent’s slanders. Now Socrates at first seems to be playing by the usual rules. When responding to the ‘old charges’ that he investigated things beneath the earth and in the sky, made the weaker argument defeat the stronger, and taught others to do likewise, Socrates’ denies them and appeals to general public knowledge regarding his activities:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>I offer the majority (<span class="term">hoi polloi</span>) of you as witnesses, and I ask you to teach and advise (<span class="term">didaskein kai phrazein</span>) one another; those among you who have heard me in conversation—there are many (<span class="term">polloi</span>) of you—inform each other, please, whether any of you ever heard me discussing anything of that sort</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">19d</span>).</div>

<div class="p">This call upon the jurymen-citizens to act as character witnesses for a defendant sounds pretty standard, but Socrates immediately introduces a strange note: <span class="quote_inline">From that [asking each other] you will come to know the status of the other things that the multitude (<span class="term">hoi polloi</span>) says about me</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">19d</span>). Rather than taking the expected line (by consulting public opinion you will learn that my current accusers are speaking falsely), Socrates asks the jurors to learn by individual investigation that the general opinion of the mass of citizens (<span class="term">hoi polloi</span>) was false. He seeks, in effect, to establish a conversational, dialectical relationship among the jurors which privileges individual knowledge and rejects the general knowledge of the many en masse. The key shift is in the status of the highly charged term <span class="term">hoi polloi</span>: <span class="quote_inline">many of you</span> have heard Socrates and should inform your fellow citizens of what you know of him in order to falsify the slanderous claims of ‘the many’ generally. In this short passage Socrates brings the positive, democratic marking of the term <span class="term">hoi polloi</span> into competition with a negative, critical marking of the same term.</div>

<div class="p">Socrates explicitly accepts the priority in time and in importance to his case of deep-set public opinion (old accusers over new: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">18a-c</span>), but he turns the standard rhetorical tactic on its head by pointing out the general congruity between the current charges and the opinion of himself that the citizenry has formed over time: he points out that the old accusation that <span class="quote_inline">Socrates is an atheistic scientific investigator and a sophistical teacher</span> is the basis of the current charges of impiety and corruption of the youth. The new accusers (the prosecutor and his associates) form the tip of a much larger iceberg: the prejudice that had been building against Socrates for a very long time.</div>

<div class="p">Socrates professes to believe that he is not seriously endangered by the visible new accusers, who, despite their rhetorical skill (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">17b</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">18b</span>), could be refuted by simple logic. Through cross examination Socrates shows, for example, that the lead prosecutor, Meletus, believes that the Athenian <span class="term">Assemblymen</span>, <span class="term">Councilmen</span>, and <span class="term">jurors</span> all educate and improve the youth, while only Socrates corrupts them. This is shown to be illogical by an analogy with horse training: it is <span class="quote_inline">of course</span> true that only one or a few men know how to improve horses through training while <span class="quote_inline"><span class="term">hoi polloi</span>, when they try to train horses, actually corrupt them and the same is true of all other animals</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">25a-b</span>). The fact that Meletus will not acknowledge the force of this argument for the <span class="quote_inline">training</span> of the Athenian youth is taken to show that he has never given any thought to the subject of education (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">24e-25c</span>). The problem with this line of reasoning, from the point of view of persuading the jury, is that most Athenian jurymen would be likely to agree with Meletus that the <span class="term">Assemblymen</span> and so on did educate the youth through their decisions. Thus, according to Socrates’ implied horses=youths analogy, most Athenians are convicted along with Meletus of giving no care to the education of the youth. Rather than isolating his opponent, Socrates reveals that his opponent’s views are indeed in harmony with those of most Athenians. The juror who is persuaded by Socrates will also set himself against the ordinary wisdom of the mass of citizens.</div>

<p>Socrates has thus set himself a staggering rhetorical challenge: in order to be acquitted he must bring at least 250 individual jurors over to his side, after having reminded them in no uncertain terms that it is his opponent whose position is in conformity with popular opinion. Socrates must, in a very short time, persuade each juror to acknowledge that what he has learned since childhood about Socrates is fundamentally in error. This acknowledgment carries the burden of accepting that the way the citizens currently gain their knowledge about the affairs of the <span class="term">polis</span> is faulty. Moreover, because of faulty knowledge, it is the citizens en masse who corrupt the youth of the <span class="term">polis</span> and only a truly knowledgeable man might be able to improve them.</p>

<div class="p">Having started off on this risky course, Socrates might be expected to show that the old accusations should properly be discounted because they were circulated by tendentious enemies and are incongruent with the core beliefs of democratic ideology. But Socrates makes exactly the opposite point: he admits that he cannot name his <span class="quote_inline">old accusers</span> or identify the source of the long-circulating rumors which accuse him (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">18c-d</span>). Thus the jury is left to suppose that the rumors had arisen spontaneously among the citizens as a result of his public behavior. This is the sort of spontaneous popular rumor that the public orator Aeschines (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">2.145</span>), for example, would later claim had an almost divine status and completely legitimate role to play in the democratic city. Far from attempting to refute that sort of assumption, Socrates embraces the fact that in the opinion of most citizens he was an enemy to the ideals of the democracy and he states forthrightly that those who fell into popular suspicion were likely to be dealt with harshly: 

<blockquote class="quote"><p>But as I said before, a great deal of enmity has risen against me among many people (<span class="term">pros pollous</span>), and you know very well that this is true. And that is what will convict me, if I am convicted—not Meletus, not Anytus, but the grudging slander and envy of <span class="term">hoi polloi</span>. It has convicted many other good and decent men (<span class="term">pollous kai allous kai agathous</span>); I think it will convict me; nor will it be surprising if it fails to stop with me</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">28a-b</span>).</div>

<div class="p">The Athenian litigant, especially one accused of a crime against the public (like impiety), was expected to demonstrate his record of public duty and, preferably, to show that he not only performed the officially mandated services to the state but that he was an avid and voluntary public benefactor. Once again, Socrates seems at first glance to be playing along. He refers with obvious pride to his record of military service and underlines that it was service to the democracy: <blockquote class="quote"><p>When the commanders that you (<span class="term">humeis</span>) elected to command me stationed me at Potidaea and Amphipolis and Delion, I remained there like anyone else, and ran the risk of death</p></blockquote> <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">(28e)</span>. This appeal to one’s sterling military record is a familiar rhetorical topos (cf. <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschines 2.168-70</span>). But Socrates’ statement is embedded not in a standard list of state services, but in an explanation of why Socrates would refuse to obey a hypothetical legal order forbidding him to pursue philosophy.</div>

<div class="p">Like other Athenian litigants, Socrates claims to be a selfless benefactor of the <span class="term">polis</span> in that he had exhausted his private resources in the pursuit of the public good (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">23b-c</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">30a</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">31a-c</span>). Because he does what is good for his fellow citizens (<span class="term">astoi</span>) for whom he feels regard, friendship (<span class="term">humas…aspazomai men kai philo</span>: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">29d</span>) and a special closeness due to kinship (<span class="term">mou engutero este genei</span>: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">30a</span>) despite the danger to which this exposes him, Socrates claims to be a benefactor of the Athenians. But the standard rhetorical claim was based on the transfer of material goods from the private estate of the litigant to the <span class="term">polis</span>. By contrast, Socrates claims that he should be rewarded for inflicting therapeutic pain upon his fellows. He famously explains his benefaction to the <span class="term">polis</span> as analogous to the good done by a gadfly to <blockquote class="quote"><p>a large and well bred horse, a horse grown sluggish because of its size and in need of being roused… I rouse you. I persuade you. I upbraid you. I never stop lighting on each one of you, everywhere, all day long. Such a one will not easily come to you again, gentlemen… Perhaps you will swat me, persuaded by Anytus that you may lightly kill. Then you will continue to sleep out your lives, unless the god sends someone else to look after you.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">30e-31a</span>)</div>

<p>Socrates’ equine metaphor is tongue-in-cheek (<span class="term">geloioteron eipein</span>: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">30e</span>), but recalls the point of his earlier horse-training analogy when refuting Meletus: the mass of Athenian citizens, like their children, can best be regarded as a lazy beast in need of being disciplined by the rare individual who understands what is in fact good for them. On this reading, popular ideology is no better than a state of sleep, popular opinions are mere dreams. The people only come awake, and then momentarily, when stung by Socrates. Left to their own devices, dreamers have no hope of properly running the affairs of the <span class="term">polis</span>, much less of improving it. Once again, this is a hard pill for many jurors to swallow.</p>

<div class="p">The peroration of his first speech gave Socrates one last chance to confound the expectations of his judges. An Athenian defendant would often wind up his plea to the jury with a family tableau; the display in court of young sons, relatives, and friends was an expression of solidarity with the citizenry as a kinship group and reminded the jury of the consequences to the <span class="term">polis</span> of removing the head of a family. Socrates pointedly refuses to engage in this touching ritual (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">34c-e</span>).Moreover, instead of simply saying <span class="quote_inline">I won’t be bringing on my three sons,</span> Socrates pointedly reminds the members of the jury that they themselves, as litigants, may have used the tableau tactic (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">34c</span>). He then claims that such behavior in his case would be shameful (<span class="term">aischron</span>) and offensive to his personal reputation <span class="term">(doxa)</span> and that of the <span class="term">polis</span>. Why? Because he is regarded as a superior sort of person and distinct from <span class="term">hoi polloi</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">34e-35a</span>). Furthermore, it would be impious, since attempting to invoke pity might seem to be a way of urging the jurors to foreswear their oath to judge according to the evidence (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">35b-d</span>). Here, Socrates overtly sets himself up as morally superior to <span class="term">hoi polloi</span>, the ordinary men who made up the jury: cowardly behavior in which you indulge is shameful for a distinguished man like me. He establishes a separate standard of dignified behavior for himself that is far removed from the democratic notion of citizen dignity as protection against verbal or physical insult by the powerful.</div>

<div class="p">Democratic dignity was regarded by the Athenians as a collective possession of the citizenry, guaranteed by the collective political will of the people—as expressed especially in judicial decisions. It is the will of the many exercised in defense of the honor of the individual citizen who might be incapable of holding his own against a powerful and arrogant man. Socratic dignity by contrast is adherence to a personal standard of virtue: the self-willed determination of the one good man to avoid shaming himself and, by extension, his <span class="term">polis</span> by refusing to <span class="quote_inline">stage these pathetic dramas</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">35b</span>). Moreover, Socrates denies the central, if unofficial, role of the court as an agent of social control. Socrates claims that the only legitimate approach for a juror who would not impiously foreswear himself was to judge the matter at hand against a fixed standard of justice. While most jurors no doubt regarded justice as a paramount concern, they defined justice as the good of the democratic <span class="term">polis</span>. That good demanded that judges take into account a litigant’s standing as a citizen. And that standing was demonstrated, in part, by his integration into a network of kin and friends.</div>

<p>When viewed through the historical prism of an Athenian juryman’s expectations, Socrates’ speech (as reported by Plato) is revealed as a real shocker and Socrates’ professed amazement at the relatively high number of positive votes (some 220, as against some 280 for conviction: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">36a</span>) seems warranted. The <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> is a demonstration of an ‘alternative’ and openly critical use of the ordinarily democratic genre of courtroom rhetoric. Rather than employing speech to demonstrate conformity with and submission to a democratic ethos that emphasized equality among citizens and their collective wisdom, Plato’s Socrates employs it as a form of provocation and cultural criticism:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Perhaps you think, Athenians, that I have been convicted for lack of words (<span class="term">aporia logon</span>) to persuade you, that I thought it right to do and say anything to be acquitted. Not so. It is true I have been convicted for a lack; not a lack of words, but lack of bold shamelessness, unwillingness to say the things that you would find it most pleasant (<span class="term">hedista</span>) to hear—lamenting and wailing, saying and doing many things I claim to be unworthy of me, but things of the sort you are accustomed to hear from others. I did not then think it necessary to do anything unworthy of a free man (aneleutheron) because of danger; I do not now regret so having conducted my defense; and I would far rather die with that defense than live with the other.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">38d-e</span>)</div>

<p>Socrates follows this overt rejection of conformity with a prophesy: The Athenians are killing him in a vain attempt to free themselves from his stubborn insistence that they examine their own beliefs, but following Socrates’ death they will be pursued by younger, fiercer, more numerous critics. Thus, he suggests, the prudent response to Socratic criticism is not to kill the one gentle critic they now have, but to take care to make themselves into better people (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">39c-d</span>). That is, each Athenian must abandon his illogical, ideological, democratic convictions and seek to find better, more logically consistent alternatives.</p>

<p>This section, and the text as a whole, make it clear that Socrates saw his own fierce, biting criticism of the status quo, both before and during the trial, as ‘doing good’: being a social critic is his duty to his god, himself, and his <span class="term">polis</span>. Socrates believed himself assigned to the country of his birth as a beneficial gadfly and the speech in his ‘defense’ can be regarded as his last, best sting. Socrates, as depicted in Plato’s <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span>, never sought out a mass audience but he chose to employ his trial in a final attempt to educate his fellow citizens. Although Socrates doubted his own ability to persuade his judges, we must suppose that because he did address the jury (rather than keeping a dignified silence) he kept open the possibility that he might succeed in educating some or all of them. Socrates’ use of the trial as an educational opportunity is in line with his self-description as a good citizen and public benefactor. If Socrates had been convinced that his fellow citizens were ineducable, if he had been concerned only with improving his own soul, he would have had nothing to say at a public trial. The fact that Socrates did offer a defense proves that he sought to improve his <span class="term">polis</span>: proves that Socrates was, in short, both a philosophical social critic and a citizen.</p>

<p>The <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> presents Socrates as a highly patriotic citizen who attempted to improve his fellows through beneficial provocation and criticism of popular ideas. Socrates avoided addressing the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, but he carried out his critical obligations in public places as well as in private houses. The trial speech itself represents a sincere attempt to employ public rhetoric for the purposes of mass education. Socrates’ speech also projected the likely outcome of openly engaging in social criticism: the death of the dissident at the hands of those he attempted to improve. Plato’s dialogue <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span>, which continues the story of the last days of Socrates, reiterates the central themes that ‘democratic knowledge’ was tantamount to ignorance, that it was a philosopher-citizen’s duty to criticize ignorance, and that fatal consequences could attend the public practice of dissent. The setting of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span> is the public prison of Athens; Socrates is awaiting his execution and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span> is attempting to persuade him to cooperate in a prison escape that has been planned by Socrates’ friends. But, in stark contrast to what we moderns have come to accept as the standard prison-escape plot, Socrates refuses to move unless <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span> can prove that escaping prison would be a just thing to do.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="crito"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Plato’s <span class="titlem">Crito</span></span></h2>


<div class="p">The <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span> opens with an elaboration of the ‘expert’ argument that Socrates had used to demonstrate that Meletus had no concern for the education of the young. Crito has urged Socrates to escape from prison, on the grounds that if Socrates were executed <span class="quote_inline"><span class="term">hoi polloi</span>, who don’t really know you or me will think</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">44b</span>) that Crito had failed in his duty to save Socrates, given that saving him was within his power. Socrates’ notes that surely <span class="quote_inline">we</span> should not be concerned with what <span class="term">hoi polloi</span> think of us, and that <span class="quote_inline">reasonable men</span> (<span class="term">hoi epieikestatoi</span>) the only ones worth considering—would understand the course of events <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">(44c)</span>. But Crito replies that the outcome of the trial had made all too clear <span class="quote_inline">how necessary it really is to care about what <span class="term">hoi polloi</span> think,</span> since they can accomplish nearly the greatest of evils when a man has been slandered among them (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">44d</span>). Socrates demolishes Crito’s position by the analogical argument for technical expertise: just as in the case of physical training, he who hopes for self-improvement must pay attention to the knowledgeable few and ignore the advice of the ignorant many (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">46b-48b</span>). Socrates scornfully comments that the considerations Crito has raised—Socrates’ supporters’ financial loss, the fate of Socrates’ own children, what people think—<span class="quote_inline">are really fit topics for people who kill lightly and would raise to life again without a thought if they could: <span class="term">hoi polloi</span> themselves.</span> In contrast, for ‘us’ the choice of how to act is determined by justice, and justice is to be discovered only through logical argument (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">48c-d</span>).</div>

<p>The escape urged by Crito is then shown to be unjust on the basis of Socrates’ remarkable premise that, contrary to popular belief, it is never right to commit injustice (<span class="term">adikein</span>)/do harm (<span class="term">kakon poiein</span>), even in response to injury (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">49a-50a</span>). Since escape would constitute a harm, it is unjust, and so the substantive question has been settled just a few minutes into the dialogue. But Socrates then sets out to show, by an imaginary conversation with the reified Laws (<span class="term">nomoi</span>) of Athens that <span class="term">a fortiori</span> it is wrong to harm one’s own <span class="term">polis</span> which had done one not harm but good.</p>

<div class="p">The Laws as imagined by Socrates initially posit that escape constitutes injury because it meant breaking the law and the <span class="term">polis</span> cannot continue to exist if the laws are without force (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">50a-b</span>). Socrates asks Crito: how we are to answer that one? and he points out that <blockquote class="quote"><p>a good deal might be said, especially by a political orator on behalf of that law (<span class="term">nomos</span>), now to be broken [by the proposed escape], which requires judgments judicially rendered (<span class="term">dikai</span>) to be authoritative</p></blockquote> (<span class="term">kuriai</span>: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">50b</span>). The mention of the political orator is interesting. It signals that while Socrates and democratic politicians both believe that laws and judgments must be authoritative, they approach the matter quite differently. What then might an Athenian orator have said in favor of the democratic approach? In his speech <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">Against Meidias</span></span>, written in <span class="date">346</span> B.C., a half-century after the trial of Socrates, Demosthenes presents a detailed brief for why the laws must remain authoritative if the dignity of ordinary citizens is to be protected from attacks by powerful, wealthy, clever men. Demosthenes assumes that powerful men will always desire to demonstrate their power by harming the weak, and he does not consider the possibility that they would be restrained by any internal concern for abstract justice. Nor are the laws themselves, mere inscribed letters, capable of guaranteeing compliance. Rather, the appropriate insurance of legal authority is the collective action of the citizenry: the legal judgment and its consequences. Vigorous public punishment of outrageous behavior will serve to intimidate the powerful and will force them into compliance with the will of the many. In Demosthenes’ argument, it is thus the mass of citizens, acting as jurors on the initiative of a voluntary prosecutor, that is the collective agent that ensures the authority of law. It is only when the people are unwilling to use their collective power to restrain the powerful that the law will lose its authority. Although Demosthenes was not yet born in <span class="date">399</span> B.C., Socrates seems to be pointing to this sort of claim in his reference to the many things that an orator might say about the authority of law and judgment.</div>

<div class="p">Socrates’ position on the basis of legal authority is radically different from Demosthenes’ in that it bases the survival of legal authority on the individual’s private decision to behave ethically, rather than on the public exertion of power by the people acting collectively, as a citizenry. Thus, maintaining the rule of law is (for Socrates) an issue of ethics not politics, and it depends upon the behavior of the individual not upon that of the collectivity. The basis of the Socratic legal order is a just contract between the Laws and the individual citizen. According to the terms of that contract, Socrates had agreed to abide by the procedural forms of Athenian law and to obey the legal judgments rendered according to the procedural rules, even though those judgments might be substantively incorrect. His obedience was given in exchange for having received from the Laws specific goods: his birth (because of the laws regarding marriage), his nurture (<span class="term">trophe</span>), and his education (<span class="term">paideia</span>). Moreover, the Laws claim that because Socrates is the <span class="quote_inline">son and slave</span> of the Laws, the parties to the contract are not on an equal footing, <blockquote class="quote"><p>We bore you, reared you, and educated you (<span class="term">egenou te kai exetraphes kai epaideuthes</span>). Can you then say, first of all, that you are not our offspring and our slave—you and your ancestors before you? And if that’s true, do you think that justice is on an equal basis between you and us that it is right for you to do in return what we may undertake to do to you?</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">50e</span>).</div>

<p>Socrates has already explained that he cannot ethically do anything substantively harmful to any entity. In this passage the Laws demonstrate that for any citizen to break the law is manifestly to do harm to an entity that deserves special respect and gratitude. Therefore harming the Laws (even in response to an injury) is seen to be unjust even from the perspective of a traditional Greek help-your-friends/harm-your-enemies ethics. And thus, by escaping, Socrates who, in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span>, had publicly announced his moral superiority, would sink beneath the ethical standard demanded of <span class="term">hoi polloi</span>.</p>

<div class="p">The demonstration that it is unjust for any citizen to disobey legal judgments that were procedurally correct whether or not they are substantially correct is now complete, but the Laws go on to make an <span class="term">a fortiori</span> argument regarding Socrates himself, which slides into an overtly rhetorical appeal. Socrates, say the Laws, affirmed the contract more than anyone else, since he absented himself from the <span class="term">polis</span> less than anyone, and thus he should feel particular shame (<span class="term">aischune</span>) in breaking it. He did not even desire to gain first-hand knowledge of other <span class="term">poleis</span> and their laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">52b</span>), although he often asserted that Sparta and Crete were well governed <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">(52e)</span>. Moreover Socrates will be an object of mockery (<span class="term">katagelastos</span>) if he escapes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">53a</span>) and the whole <span class="quote_inline">Socrates affair</span> will <span class="quote_inline">appear utterly indecent</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">53c</span>). He will degrade himself by sneaking out of town dressed like a runaway slave and will live a slavish existence in foreign parts where he will amuse his audiences with the absurd tale of his clandestine flight in peasant costume. Moreover, if he ever offends his new hosts, Socrates can expect to <span class="quote_inline">hear many a contemptuous thing said of you</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">53d-e</span>). If he brings his children with him, they will be raised and educated as non-Athenians (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">54a</span>). The Laws’ peroration returns to the nurture theme: <span class="quote_inline">be persuaded by us, for we nurtured you</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">54b</span>). They assure him that if he obeys the Laws, Socrates will die the victim of injustice at the hands of fallible men (i.e. the jurors who were misled into defining Socrates’ behavior as constituting impiety), not at the hands of the law (which prescribed only the procedure for prosecution of impiety, not its definition). Finally, they threaten him with posthumous punishment by their <span class="quote_inline">brothers, the Laws in the Place of the Dead</span> if he disobeys (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">54b-c</span>). The dialogue concludes with Socrates’ statement that 
<blockquote class="quote"><p>I seem to hear these things as the Corybants seem to hear the pipes, and the droning murmur of the words sounds within me and makes me incapable of hearing anything else. Be assured that if you speak against the things that now seem to me to be so (<span class="term">ta nun emoi dokounta</span>), you will speak in vain. Still, if you suppose you can accomplish anything, please do speak</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">54d</span>).</div>

<p>Not surprisingly, Crito has no reply and so the Laws carry the day.</p>

<div class="section" id="apology_crito_conclusion"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">Platos’s <span class="titlem">Apology</span> and <span class="titlem">Crito</span>: summation</span></h2>


<p>The <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span>, taken together, may be read as establishing an ‘ethics of social criticism.’ The Socratic code reflects Socrates’ own way of life, which had been lived according to unrefuted principles established in uncoerced conversations. These principles were hypothetical, but the aspiring philosopher would be expected to follow them unless and until he refuted them by logical argument. As we have seen, Socrates’ life was spent in attempting to improve his fellows by philosophical conversations held in public and private places. Socrates attempts to do good for his fellow citizens because he believes that has both a duty and a capacity to do so. His duty is implied both by his interpretation of the Delphic oracle’s comment regarding his unsurpassed wisdom as having the force of an order. It is further demonstrated by the contractual argument of the Laws in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span>. While Socrates’ duty is not put in terms of a traditional obligation to return a favor for favors received, that is what every Athenian reader would understand the Laws of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span> as driving at. The establishment of a duty to seek to do good (as well as to avoid doing harm) is the deafening ‘music’ that Socrates hears as he listens avidly to the rhetorical arguments of the Laws, long after the assertion of the no-harm doctrine has made his choice clear. Socrates’ capacity to do good for his fellows is implied by the extended gadfly metaphor. He imagines that his critical sting really can awaken at least some Athenians and he refuses to regard anyone as ineducable. His conviction that he had a duty and a capacity to improve others was (or at least Plato supposed it was) why the real, historical Socrates chose to defend himself before the mass audience of Athenian jurors in <span class="date">399</span>.</p>

<p>Plato, however, did not imitate Socrates’ own manner of life. He did not allow his private estate to fall into ruin in the philanthropic pursuit of the betterment of Athens, nor did he haunt the public square seeking philosophical conversations with passers-by. Instead, he withdrew to his private think-tank, the Academy, where he conversed with a few carefully chosen students, most of them non-citizens. He was not perceived as a public figure, as Socrates had been, and never had trouble with Athenian law. By choosing a quietist path and avoiding the opportunities for philosophical conversation in public places that had typified Socrates’ life, Plato seemingly disobeyed certain aspects of Socrates’ ethical code as sketched out in <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span>. Assuming that Plato remained true to the injunction that we should live our lives on the basis of unrefuted philosophical arguments, we must ask: did he find a way to refute Socrates’ ethics of criticism?</p>

<p>I would suggest that he did, and that the refutation is to be found in the great dialogues <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Gorgias</span></span> and the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span>. Of course I do not have the space here to work through the argument of those two massive texts, but by way of conclusion, let me pick out just a couple of passages that bear on the matter of Socrates’ role as a social critic.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="gorgias"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">Plato’s <span class="titlem">Gorgias</span></span></h2>



<div class="p">The <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Gorgias</span></span> centers on matters of ethics, political justice, and the problematic role of persuasion in the political life of the <span class="term">polis</span>. The bulk of the dialogue consists of a long interchange between Socrates and Callicles—a politically ambitious Athenian citizen who is studying with the rhetoric-teacher Gorgias. Callicles believes that mastery of rhetoric will make him a powerful man and assure him personal security against any threats to his person or his standing. Callicles scorns Socrates for failing to avail himself of the powerful weapons afforded by the art of public speaking. He claims that Socrates would be incapable of protecting himself if someone sought to do him harm. In response, Socrates seeks to show Callicles that the power and security associated with rhetorical skill is illusory, and that in fact rhetorical skill ends in nothing other than the enslavement of the speaker to the whims of his audience: For Socrates, anyone who seeks to persuade a mob ends up being nothing more than the unwitting tool of the passions of the mob. By contrast, Socrates claims that his own, philosophical ‘craft of politics’ is aimed specifically at the improvement of the citizens—he, Socrates, is like a doctor, although the therapy he offers is described in metaphors of military combat. Socrates at one point defines his own approach to <span class="quote_inline">doing good in the polis</span> as <span class="quote_inline">going to battle with the Athenians</span> (<span class="term">diamachesthai Ath enaiois</span>: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">521a-c</span>).</div>

<div class="p">Those who willingly engage in battle, rather than spending their time in preparing the means of personal security, risk their lives. Callicles warns Socrates that he is overconfident about his chances of survival. But Socrates responds that he knows perfectly well that in <span class="quote_inline">this <span class="term">polis</span></span> anything can happen and he fully expects that if he is accused by some evil man he will in fact be killed. His fate is assured precisely because he is one of the few Athenians, if not the only one <span class="quote_inline">truly to undertake the political craft and to practice politics</span> (<span class="term">prattein ta politika</span>: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">521c-e</span>), that is to say, the only one who tries to improve his fellow citizens through critical struggle, rather than seeking to gratify them. Because he will not address his fellows in the flattering way they desire, Socrates’ position in court will, he says, be equivalent to that of a doctor being prosecuted by a pastrycook before a jury of children. If the doctor claims that his nasty-tasting medicine is really good for the ignorant brats, won’t they just make a great fuss (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">521e-522a</span>)? The doctor in such a trial would be at an utter dead end (<span class="term">en pas ei aporiai</span>: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">522a-b</span>) regarding what to say—and so will Socrates when accused of corrupting the youth and slandering their elders by saying harsh words <span class="quote_inline">in private or public.</span> He will <blockquote class="quote"><p>be able to say neither the truth, that <span class="quote_inline">Justly I say all those things and I do so acting in your interest (<span class="term">to humeteron d etouto</span>), jurymen,</span> nor anything else</p></blockquote> (<span class="term">oute allo ouden</span>). And so he will suffer whatever comes his way (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">522b-c</span>). Yet if he is convicted due to a lack of flattering rhetoric, he won’t mind; it is only conviction on a true charge of having done injustice that Socrates fears.</div>

<p>This passage presents a problem, because it seems to contradict the account of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span>, in which Socrates has a good deal to say to the Athenians, and specifically on on the subject of the benefits he has done them. Leaving aside the insoluble question of what the real Socrates really said on that day in <span class="date">399</span> B.C., what sort of comment on the ‘Socratic ethics of criticism’ is implied by Socrates’ prediction here in Plato’s <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Gorgias</span></span> of his own courtroom silence? Plato’s re-writing of his own earlier account of the trial in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> underlines the new ethical position Socrates has arrived at in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Gorgias</span></span>. Socrates’ speech, the reader now realizes, cannot have positive public effects for two reasons: First, because Socrates cannot and will not converse with a mob. But, more importantly, because even in an uncoerced one-on-one conversation with an intelligent fellow citizen like Callicles, Socrates’ rhetoric is insufficient to reeducate an individual who has been thoroughly ideologized by the democratic political culture. Thus Plato has shown that Socrates actually has no real capacity to do good in his <span class="term">polis</span> (he cannot ‘heal’ either the political community as a group or the would-be political leader) by ‘rhetorical’ means and so there is no purpose served in delivering a passionate and would-be pedagogical speech in his own defense. Realizing this, Plato’s character Socrates in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Gorgias</span></span> prefers to defend his own dignity by keeping silent before the childlike jurymen.</p>

<p>The <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Gorgias</span></span>, I would suggest, by showing that Socrates actually has no capacity to do good in the ‘real world’ <span class="term">polis</span> of democratic Athens, kicks out one of the two key props from under the Socratic code of critical ethics. In the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span> Plato goes after the second prop, by showing why it is that Socrates actually has no duty to try to do good either.</p>

</div>

<div class="section" id="republic"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">Plato’s <span class="titlem">Republic</span></span></h2>



<div class="p">The Laws of <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span>, we remember, had claimed that Socrates must either accept his own execution or break his just and voluntary contract with them. The terms of that contract had specified the exchange of obedience to the city’s Laws for Socrates’ having received and accepted specific goods: his birth, nurture (<span class="term">trophe</span>), and education (<span class="term">paideia</span>: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span> 50e</span>). The <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span> brings all of this (and therefore the fairness of the contract) into question. In Book 7, when reiterating the absolute responsibility of the philosopher-king of the utopian state of <span class="term">Kallipolis</span> to <span class="quote_inline">return to the cave</span> and take part in ruling the <span class="term">polis</span>, Socrates allows that the philosopher in <span class="quote_inline">other <span class="term">poleis</span></span> has no responsibility to take part in public affairs:</div>
 
<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>We’ll say that when such men [philosophers] come to be in the other <span class="term">poleis</span> it is fitting for them not to participate (<span class="term">metechousi</span>) in the miserable labors (<span class="term">ponon</span>) [of those places], for they [the philosophers] grew themselves up of their own will, and against the will of the <span class="term">politeia</span> in each case (<span class="term">automatoi gar emphuontai akous es t es en hekast ei politeias</span>). So it is just that the nature which is self-made (<span class="term">to autophues</span>) and owes its upbringing (<span class="term">trophe</span>) to no one (<span class="term">medeni troph en opheilon</span>) is less than eager to repay the price of its upbringing (<span class="term">tropheia</span>) to anyone.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span> 520a-b</span>)</div>

<p>By contrast, if a philosopher in Kallipolis shows reluctance to leave off the pleasures of pure contemplation and return to the cave, the other philosophers will say to him:</p>

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>But you we have caused to be born (<span class="term">egenn esamen</span>) for your own sake and for the sake of the rest of the <span class="term">polis</span> (<span class="term">tei te all ei polei</span>), like the leaders and kings in beehives. You have been better and more fully educated (<span class="term">pepaideumenos</span>) and are more able to participate (<span class="term">metechein</span>) in both activities [ruling and contemplating].</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">520b</span>)</div>

<div class="p">This is very close to the contractual argument that the Laws had pressed upon Socrates in <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span>: because <span class="quote_inline">we</span> are responsible for your birth, upbringing, and education <span class="quote_inline">you</span> owe us obedience in repayment for goods received, and because of the implied contract you must do that which may not initially seem to you most desirable.</div>

<div class="p">After completing the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span>’s long discussion of the special education required to make a philosopher-king, the reader knows what a genuinely beneficial upbringing and education for a person with Socrates’ innate abilities and character would be like. The upbringing and education that Socrates actually received from the formal laws and informal customary practices of the democratic <span class="term">polis</span> not at all similar to those prescribed for the future rulers of Plato’s ideal state, Kallipolis. Socrates of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span> has, in effect, explained that he owes nothing to Athens. The democratic <span class="term">polis</span> had contributed nothing positive to his upbringing, and worse, had been <span class="quote_inline">unwilling</span> to have him bring himself up as a philosopher. Moreover, Socrates of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span> has explained that the education offered by the assembled masses consisted of raw indoctrination and he has stated bluntly that no private education could hope to stand up to the ideological bombardment of democratic education (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">492b-e</span>).</div>

<div class="p">If Socrates of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span> is right about the absence of appropriate upbringing and education offered the philosopher in the real city and the crude indoctrination enforced by the mob, then the Laws of Athens in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span> are shown to be liars. Their contractual argument is falsified when it is viewed from the rarified heights of Kallipolis. Indeed, the argument of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span> leads us to suppose that the Laws of Athens had sought to corrupt Socrates’ soul by attempting to teach him to flatter and mimic the masses. When viewed from Kallipolis, the Laws’ argument that Socrates was their <span class="quote_inline">son</span> and <span class="quote_inline">slave</span> appears not only false, but sinister. Had Socrates been educated as the Laws of Athens had wished, he (like the unhappy sophist described elsewhere in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span>) would indeed have been trained to be a slave of the <span class="quote_inline">great beast</span>—that is, of the democratic <span class="term">assembly</span>. But somehow Socrates had educated himself (<span class="term">automatos</span>) to be a true philosopher. What then becomes of the Laws’ conclusion in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span> that the fatherland, must always be revered and obeyed and to Socrates’ claim in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> that he was duty-bound to try to improve his native <span class="term">polis</span> because of the demands of friendship and kinship?</div>

<div class="p">Socrates of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span> answers obliquely at the end of <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span> Book 9</span>, in the course of a discussion about when it is right to take an active role in politics. The ‘kingly’ man, he says, willingly undertakes political affairs (<span class="term">ta… politika… prattein</span>) <span class="quote_inline">in his own <span class="term">polis</span>, but perhaps not in his native land except by divine providence</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">592a</span>). His friend Glaucon grasps his meaning: by <span class="quote_inline">his own polis</span> you refer our ideal <span class="term">polis</span> of Kallipolis. Socrates affirms this: the model (paradeigma) exists in heaven and by this model the philosopher-king establishes a ‘political regime’ in his own soul. Thus it does not really matter if the ideal <span class="term">polis</span> ever comes into being or not: a perfect individual soul is enough. With this argument, we may suppose that the argument of the Laws of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span> for the existence of a binding contract is overthrown; not only is the contract fundamentally unfair (in that it demands that substantial harms be repaid by benefits) but outside Kallipolis the philosopher’s <span class="quote_inline">true <span class="term">polis</span></span> (the entity he must seek to improve) is his own soul, not his native land and not even the souls of his fellow citizens.</div>

</div>

<div class="section" id="conclusion"><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">Conclusion</span></h2>



<div class="p">Thus by the end of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span> it is only by abandoning politics and history—the project of working to achieve justice in a real <span class="term">polis</span>—that Plato manages to solve the challenge posed by Socrates’ ethical demand that a true philosopher must <span class="quote_inline">play the gadfly</span> with the lazy horse of his fellow citizens. Apparently, neither Plato nor any other philosopher-Athenian owes anything substantial to real-world Athens and thus he is in no way duty-bound to seek the improvement of the <span class="term">polis</span> or its residents. To the extent that the reader (ancient or modern) is dismayed by Plato’s willingness to sunder philosophy from history and politics, to separate private self-improvement from public responsibility for the general welfare, he or she must regret the invalidation of the contract urged by the Laws in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span>. With the rejection of the contract that the historical Socrates had willingly died to uphold, the Platonic philosophical project gains the capacity to change its entire nature, and some of us may feel that the change will not be for the better. In light of these regrets, we might ask: is here something missing from the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Republic</span></span>’s argument for tossing the contract aside?</div>

<div class="p">What seems notoriously left out of the contract that the Laws of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span> press upon Socrates is the positive benefit he had received from the freedom of the democratic <span class="term">polis</span> and its unprecedented tolerance (even celebration) of diversity among its citizens. Socrates of the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span> alludes to this only obliquely, by suggesting that he would not have much success practicing his philosophy on the relatively <span class="quote_inline">well governed</span> Megarians or Thebans (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span> 53b-c</span>, cf. <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apol.</span> 37c-d</span>). The historical Socrates had been regarded by many of his fellow citizens as a loudmouth, know-it-all, and potential troublemaker for at least twenty-five years before the trial of <span class="date">399</span> B.C.—as Aristophanes’ comedy, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Clouds</span></span> makes clear. Thus, while Athenian democracy always had the capacity to kill Socrates, that capacity was ordinarily counter-balanced by the democratic commitment to freedom of action, to free speech, and to privacy, and above all by the diverse culture of the democratic <span class="term">polis</span> itself. The multifaceted nature of the democracy ensured that the majoritarian tendency of popular opinion ordinarily remained fragmented and contingent. Athens was ordinarily tolerant of eccentric citizens like Socrates.</div>

<p>In conclusion, I think Plato’s implicit argument that Athens inevitably killed Socrates—and that Athens was inevitably hostile to the practice of philosophy—was wrong. Plato’s attempted refutation of the original Socratic ‘ethics of social criticism,’ on the grounds that philosophers had neither the capacity nor the duty to do public good, may have authorized Plato to leave the walled city and withdraw to his Academy. But it is worth remembering that the Academy was still within Athenian territory; and that Plato himself never chose to live for long in any <span class="term">polis</span> other than Athens.</p>

<p>The figure of Socrates continued to haunt the Platonic Academy, as he continues to haunt the modern Academy today—like Plato, we (teachers and students alike) may find that the challenge of being both loyal citizens of our country and severe critics of its tendencies to self-satisfied complacency and self-serving injustice are overwhelming—and we may seek to find excuses to give up criticizing or to give up being citizens. But, like Plato, when modern day Academics are tempted to give up either commitment—to abandon social criticism or <span class="term">citizenship</span>—we are stung anew by the example of the gadfly who died in <span class="date">399</span> B.C., believing in his own duty and his capacity to do public good by living as a dissident citizen in a democratic state.</p>

<p>The trial of Socrates, and Socrates’ relationship to Athens, have occasioned a great deal of scholarship. The primary sources (in translation) and some major areas of controversy are presented in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Brickhouse and Smith 2002</span>. The story of the trial is well told by <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Colaiaco</span>, who gives an even-handed assessment of the issues and full bibliography. My own understanding of the historical context of democratic Athens is laid out in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Ober 1989</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">1996</span>; my reading of Plato on Socrates is presented in more detail than is possible here in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Ober 1998</span>. <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hall 1995</span> is a lively attempt to evoke the atmosphere of a typical Athenian trial, emphasizing the importance of performance and the analogy of drama. <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Hansen 1995</span> offers a careful analysis of the trial from the point of view of Athenian citizens. <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Reeve 1989</span> is a fine philosophical analyis of Plato’s <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Apology</span></span>; on the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Crito</span></span>, see <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Kraut 1984</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Weiss 1998</span>. For a very thoughtful assessment of Socrates’ and his importance, one that is very different from the one I present here, see <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Nehamas 1998</span>.</p>
