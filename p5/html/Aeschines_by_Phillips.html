 </a>Aeschines son of Atrometus of the deme Cothocidae (<span class="date">390-ca. 322</span>) was an actor before becoming a politician, for which he
 is repeatedly lampooned by Demosthenes. He served on the
 Athenian embassies to Philip regarding the ‘Peace of
 Philocrates;’ in the period which followed his
 support for the peace brought him into constant conflict with Demosthenes. Upon his return from the second embassy in <span class="date">346</span> he was accused of taking Macedonian bribes by Demosthenes and his associate Timarchus. He
 counterattacked by prosecuting Timarchus for speaking in the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span> after having prostituted himself, and won his
 case with the oration <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against
 Timarchus’ (1)</span>. When Demosthenes
 revived the allegations of bribery in <span class="date">343</span>, Aeschines defended himself with the speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘On the False Embassy’
 (2)</span>. He barely escaped conviction, and his influence was clearly on the wane.</p>
 <p>In spring <span class="date">339</span>, as an Athenian representative at the meeting of
 the <span class="term">Amphictyonic League</span>, Aeschines successfully deflected the wrath of the League
 from Athens onto Amphissa. However, the Fourth Sacred War against Amphissa bore bitter fruit for the Athenians as well, as it brought Philip into central Greece and eventually led to the battle of
 Chaeroneia. In <span class="date">336</span>
 Aeschines indicted Ctesiphon
 for proposing the grant of a gold crown to Demosthenes.
 When the case came to trial six years later, Aeschines
 delivered his oration <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against
 Ctesiphon’ (3)</span>. Despite the legal merits of his case, he received
 less than twenty percent of the jury’s votes, and he left Athens to teach rhetoric on
 Rhodes. (See also Oratory.)</p>
