<div class="p">Thucydides was an Athenian most famous for his history of the war between Athens and Sparta, the ‘Peloponnesian War’. His father was Olorus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 4.10.4</span>), and his family was wealthy, owning property and mines in Thrace (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 4.105.1</span>). Thucydides was an eyewitness to many of the events that he describes, since he <span class="quote_inline">old enough to understand what was happening</span> in <span class="date">431 BCE</span>, when the war broke out (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 5.26.5</span>), and he held the office of ‘General’ (<span class="foreign">στρατηγός</span>) in the year <span class="date">424 BCE</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 4.104</span>; source for dates <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>). He was personally affected by the war, having caught the plague that struck Athens in <span class="date">430</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 2.48</span>), and having been active in the campaign against the Spartan Brasidas around Amphipolis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 4.108.5</span>) and having organized the defense of Eion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 4.107.1</span>). Because Brasidas ultimately defeated the Athenian defenders in the north, Thucydides was exiled from Athens for twenty years, staring in <span class="date">424 BCE</span>. He notes this fact briefly in his history, adding that his banishment allowed him easier access to information from both sides of the conflict (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 5.26</span>). From events he mentions in his history, it is clear that he lived beyond Athens’ surrender to Sparta in <span class="date">404 BCE</span>, although his history is incomplete and comes to an abrupt end while he is describing events in the winter of <span class="date">411</span> (for examples of Thucydides mentioning events of <span class="date">404</span> or later, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 6.15.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 7.57.2</span>). It seems clear, too, that he did not live much beyond <span class="date">400 BCE</span>, if at all, since he does not seem aware of any events in the <span class="date">4th century</span>.</div>

<p>Thucydides’ history is notable for its insights into politics, its organization and focus, its lack of any supernatural element, and the utter confidence of its author. For these reasons, he is often held up as the most ‘reliable’ or ‘objective’ of the ancient historians. Without detracting from the importance and brillians of his work, however, it is important to distinguish competence from objectivity, and to distinguish clear-thinking from truthfullness. For example, Thucydides admired the Athenian Pericles very much—he makes this clear throughout the work, but nowhere more explicitly than at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 2.65</span>—and this bias almost certainly determined how he interpreted the historical events he witnessed, what he chose to emphasize or deemphasize, and the kinds of connections of cause and effect he draws between events. Likewise, Thucydides inserts many speeches into his historical narrative, and introduced this practice with an explanation that is famous for being difficult to interpret. What follows is Rex Warner’s translation, which is clearer in English than Thucyides’ Greek is:</p> 

<div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>In this history I have made use of set speeches some of which were delivered just before and others during the war. I have found it difficult to remember the precise words used in the speeches which I listened to myself and my various informants have experienced the same difficulty; so my method has been, while keeping as closely as possible to the general sense of the words that were actually used, to make the speakers say what, in my opinion, was called for by each situation.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.22</span>)</div>

<p>Most students of Thucydides interpret this to mean that the historian did in fact try to ascertain the details of important speeches during the war. But, as he actually wrote his history, trying to make sense of the events that transpired, he used the speeches as occasions to expound on the psychology of the warring parties, to present theoretical discussions of political issues, and to distill fundamental causes and motivations. These speeches, then, are not documents written with an eye to historical accuracy, but dramatic elemenets, aimed illuminating underlying issues that would not otherwise come out of a strictly factual account.</p>

<p>His view of events is also limited by what he thinks important. Unlike his <span class="date">5th century</span> predecessor Herodotus, Thucydides includes virtually no women as actors in his history, and is much less concerned with the ways in which customs and mythology can influence political events.</p>

<p>So, while it would be hard to imagine a more brilliant and careful eyewitness to the events of the great war that consumed the last third of the <span class="date">5th century BCE</span>, Thucydides’ history should be read as a work that blends the reporting of historical facts with a liberal measure of selection, synthesis, and interpretation.</p>
