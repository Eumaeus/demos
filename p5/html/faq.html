 <div class="Question" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">Why does the article on [topic] not take into account the recent scholarship by [noted
 historian]?</span></h2>
 
 <p>The descriptive articles in <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> are intended as gateways to the
 primary sources for knowledge of Athenian democracy; they are not intended as the final
 word on the subject. Accordingly, those articles report what some of the primary sources
 say about the people and institutions of classical Athenian democracy, keeping
 interpretation to a minimum. We have tried to make no statement for which we cannot
 provide a citation to a primary source as evidence. Arguments about details that are build
 on complicated logical structures, standing on many sources, are beyond the immediate
 scope of these introductory articles.</p>
 <p>Our readers are encouraged to go beyond the words of the authors of
 <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> and discover ancient history for themselves. Making too
 many assertions whose validity depends on secondary literature available only to
 university academics, is not compatible with this goal.</p>
 <p>While we recognize that the primary sources leave many questions and can offer misleading
 evidence that invites sophisticated analysis by the professionally erudite, we also firmly
 believe that a useful and enlightening picture of Athenian democracy can emerge from those
 primary sources.</p>
 <p>So, the articles in the section ‘Overview, History, &amp;
 Institutions’ do not seek to incorporate the latest arguments among
 professional historians, assuming that interested readers, after exploring the primary
 sources and discovering the questions that they raise, can seek those out if they choose
 to.</p>
 <p>At the same time, we hope to supplement these descriptive articles with argumentative
 ones—Casey Dué’s article on <span class="term">
 ‘Poetry and the Dēmos: state regulation of a civic
 possession’
 </span> is one such example.</p>
 <p>So, if you would like to argue against, or add to, anything that you have found on this
 site, we would be happy to add your argument to this ongoing project. <a class="link_ref" href="mailto:cwb@stoa.org">Just let us know</a>.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="Question" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Why do you cite secondary sources as ‘evidence’ for dates?</span></h2>
 
 <p> Precise dates for events in ancient history are very difficult to calculate. Each Greek
 city had its own calendar, and none of them were particularly precise—at Athens,
 for example, extra months regularly had to be added to make the calendar keep pace with
 the seasons. So even when we know when an event happened according to the Athenian
 calendar, it can be very difficult to assign that to a particular year in our own
 calendar. For this reason, we generally cannot give a single primary source for a date,
 but must appeal to the authority of secondary sources. Bear in mind, then, that all of the
 dates in Dēmos are, first, the product of calculation and argument, and second,
 not necessarily certain.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="Question" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Why are some links dead?</span></h2>
 
 <p> The articles that make up <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> are firmly based on the primary
 sources, the ancient evidence, for our knowledge of classical Athenian Democracy. Wherever
 possible, we provide links to online versions of the primary evidence. Also, to help our
 readers evaluate the evidence for themselves, <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> includes
 descriptions of pieces of evidence, authors of ancient literary works, and genres of
 evidence. </p>
 <p>Because <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> attempts to describe adequately the workings and
 development of Athenian democracy, articles must sometimes cite evidence that is not
 available online. So, some citations are linked, and some are not. Also, not every cited
 genre, author, or work of ancient evidence has an accompanying description in
 <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> yet. So, some ‘links’ to those
 descriptions are not active.</p>
 <p><span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> has been designed so that, as evidence and descriptions of
 it come online, those ‘dead’ links will automatically become
 ‘live.’
 </p>
 </div>
 <div class="Question" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Why does Greek text look like jumbled garbage?</span></h2>
 
 <p><span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> can display Greek text in several different ways. These
 settings are available at the bottom of the <a class="link_ref" href="home">home page</a>.</p>
 <p>If you are using Mac OS X or Windows XP, choosing ‘Unicode (UTF-8) with
 pre-combined accents’ will produce the best-looking Greek. If you are using
 Mac OS X, you should use <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.omnigroup.com">OmniWeb</a> (a free
 download from <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.omnigroup.com">www.omnigroup.com</a>) or
 Apple’s <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> browser to see
 Unicode Greek. Other operating systems and browsers might handle Unicode well also.</p>
 <p>If Unicode does not work, then you can choose ‘Beta Code,’ which will
 use regular ASCII characters to represent the diacritical marks in Greek text. Or, if you
 are not interested in that, ‘Latin Transliteration’ will show you a
 phonetic approximation of the original Greek.</p>
 <p>For more information on Unicode Greek, please see <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.stoa.org/unicode/">Patrick Rourke’s excellent introduction
 to the subject on the Stoa’s site</a>. (This article is still in draft form,
 but tremendously useful nevertheless.</p>
 <p>Hugh Cayless of <a class="link_ref" href="http://oasis.unc.edu">OASIS</a> and the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.unc.edu/projects/diglib">UNC Digital Library Project</a>, is
 responsible for writing the Transcoder that allows this site to display Greek; we are
 deeply indebted to him.</p>
 <p>
 <em>Once you have set your preference for Greek display on the home page, the page will
 re-load with a new URL that includes that preference. If you bookmark that page, the
 next time you visit your preference will already be set.</em>

 </div>
 <div class="Question" id="index.xml-body.1_div.5"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">What is the logic behind the hypertext links in <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span>?</span></h2>
 
 <p>At the moment, articles in Dēmos contain four kinds of links: links that take
 the reader to individual pieces of evidence, mostly passages from ancient authors; links
 that call up information that provides useful context for the evidence; links that provide
 information on people or places; and links that cross-reference other articles that are
 part of Dēmos.</p>
 <p>Every citation to evidence in a <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> article is marked with an
 XML tag thus: <span class="bibl">Dem. 18.24</span>. As the Cocoon
 processor reads the XML document, it compares citations marked with those tags to lists of
 documents that are known to be available online. If the citation points to a text that is
 available, Cocoon will genereate a link to it. At present, <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span>
 knows what ancient texts are available on the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu">Perseus Project</a>, and the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.stoa.org/sol">Suda On
 Line</a>; over time, we hope to expand the body of evidence to which
 <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> can generate links. So, while the following two citations
 are tagged in the same way, only the latter will show up as an active link, since only it
 points to evidence that <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> knows to be online: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Arr. <span class="titlem">Anab.
 Alex.</span> 2.5</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.24</span>.</p>
 <div class="p">As the Cocoon processor renders each paragraph of text from an XML document, it generates
 a marginal note based on what citations appear in that paragraph. If it finds a citation,
 and if it can identify the author and work cited, then it will add that author and work to
 the <span class="quote_inline">Read about the evidence:</span> marginal note. The
 <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> site is home to a (growing) number of short articles
 describing ancient authors, works, and genres of evidence. If a descriptive article exists
 for a given author or work, then the marginal note will include a link to that evidence,
 as you can see in the previous paragraph. If an article describing an author is not
 available as a part of <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span>, the author’s name will be
 linked to a general search for that author’s name in certain documents of the
 <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufs.edu">Perseus digital library</a>. If no article
 exists in <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span> describing a particular work, that work will not
 be linked in the marginal note.</div>
 <p>In each paragraph, names of people, gods, Attic tribes, and Attic demes are automatically
 linked to <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufs.edu">Perseus</a> searches. In the case of
 personal names, the Cocoon processor first checks to see if <span class="titlem">Dēmos</span>
 hosts a biographical article on that person, and if so will link to it.</p>
 <p>Names of places are linked twice. In the text, the place-name is linked to a general
 search of Greek and Roman materials on <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufs.edu">Perseus</a>. But when there is a place-name in a paragraph, Cocoon will generate a
 marginal link that will perform a lookup on the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufs.edu">Perseus</a> atlas tool.</p>
