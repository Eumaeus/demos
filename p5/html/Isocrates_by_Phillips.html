<p>Isocrates son of Theodorus (<span class="date">436-338</span>) came from a prosperous Athenian family and studied philosophy as well as rhetoric in his youth. For roughly a decade after the Peloponnesian War, which greatly reduced his family’s assets, Isocrates worked as a speechwriter; six of his forensic speeches (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">16</span>-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">21</span>) survive. Around <span class="date">390</span>, however, he gave up speechwriting (a profession he would later vilify) and turned to teaching. Isocrates’ educational program professed to combine the art of rhetoric with the pursuit of morality; he thus distinguished himself both from pure theoreticians and from those concerned only with persuasion regardless of truth. His students included the historians Theopompus of Chios and Ephorus of Cyme, the orators Isaeus, Hypereides, and Lycurgus, and the general Timotheus.</p>

<p>Isocrates did not participate in Athenian politics in person; he attempted to influence policy by publishing written pamphlets and letters rather than by delivering speeches in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. Although he was careful to employ the rhetoric of democracy, Isocrates displayed marked oligarchic tendencies; for example, in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Areopagiticus’ (7)</span>. He also made his voice heard regarding foreign policy: he was a strident advocate of panhellenism, and his foremost goal was a united Greek invasion of Persia. In the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Panegyricus’ (4)</span>, published in <span class="date">380</span> after at least ten years of composition, Isocrates proposed an expedition under the joint command of Athens and Sparta. But the subsequent rise of Philip II of Macedon provided Isocrates with a new choice of hegemon, and he appealed repeatedly to Philip (in the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Philippus’ (5)</span> of <span class="date">346</span> and in <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Epistles 2</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">3</span>) to lead the Greeks against Persia. Disappointed by the results of the battle of Chaeroneia in <span class="date">338</span>, Isocrates starved himself to death, and thus did not live to see his proposal put into effect by Philip’s son and successor, Alexander the Great.
