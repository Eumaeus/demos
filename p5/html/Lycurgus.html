<p>Lycurgus son of Lycophron of the deme Boutadae (ca. <span class="date">390-324</span>) belonged to one of Athens’ most distinguished families, the <span class="term">Eteoboutads</span>. Rising to prominence after the battle of Chaeroneia, Lycurgus administered the Athenian state treasury from <span class="date">336</span> until his death. During his tenure he increased revenues, enlarged the fleet and renovated its dockyards, and oversaw a public building program. In addition, he may have reorganized the ephebic system, under which Athenian men in their first two years of adulthood underwent military training and patrolled the border of Attica.</p>

<p>An extremely pious man, Lycurgus legislated often regarding religious cults and festivals. He also saw himself as a moral reformer; as such he involved himself in numerous prosecutions, favoring especially the procedure of <span class="term"><span class="term">eisangelia</span></span> (impeachment). His sole surviving speech, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Leocrates’</span>, was delivered in an impeachment for treason. Some of his contemporaries, including Hypereides, objected that Lycurgus was overly zealous in his use of <span class="term"><span class="term">eisangelia</span></span> and impeached men for petty offenses. So vigorous was Lycurgus in his prosecution of wrongdoers that it was said that he anointed his pen not with ink but with death (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">[Plut.] <span class="titlem">Moralia</span> 841e (<span class="titlem">Vit. X Or.</span>)</span>). In <span class="date">307/6</span> the Athenians honored Lycurgus’ memory by erecting a bronze statue of him in the Ceramicus. (See also Oratory.)</p>
