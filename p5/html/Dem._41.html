<div class="p">Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Against Spudias</span>, see also Oratory. This is a speech composed by Demosthenes on behalf of a plaintiff (whose name we do not know) who is suing his brother-in-law, Spudias. The particulars of the case are these: Polyeuctus, an Athenian citizen, has wed his two daughters to two men; the older daughter was married to the plaintiff and the younger daughter to a man named Leocrates. The plaintiff, in addition to receiving the woman to wed, was also to receive a dowry of 40 minae (see also <span class="term">Money</span>). At the time of the wedding, he was to receive 30 minae with an agreement that the remaining ten will be paid to him upon Polyeuctus’ death. Leocrates, the plaintiff’s new brother-in-law, signed on as the guarantor of this agreement. In the course of time, however, Leocrates had a falling-out with his father-in-law. He divorced his wife and cut all ties with his ex-wife’s family. Polyeuctus’ daughter was soon remarried to a man by the name of Spudias. But, after Leocrates left, Polyeuctus did not have the money available to cover the additional 10 minae that he owed to the plaintiff. He solved this problem by mortgaging his house to the plaintiff only five days before his death (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.18</span>); according to <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.5</span>, the arrangement appears to be that the plaintiff would collect any money made by the estate of Polyeuctus in the form of rents, debts paid, etc. The money that was collected would be used to pay off the debt of 10 minae that was still owed the plaintiff. The mortgage, however, would not be necessary if Spudias would simply pay the money that he owes the estate of Polyeuctus. The plaintiff is suing Spudias on behalf of Polyeuctus’ widow and daughter for money that Spudias owed to Polyeuctus. This includes: 1) half a mina to cover funeral expenses for Polyeuctus, 2) eighteen minae that Spudias borrowed from Polyeuctus’ widow, 3) two minae for a slave that Spudias ‘bought’ from Polyeuctus but never paid for, and 4) certain material goods including a bowl, some jewelry, and some hangings, which Spudias later pawned (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.11</span>). With the money that the estate would receive from Spudias, the plaintiff could be paid and Polyeuctus’ house could be taken out of mortgage. According to the plaintiff, all of these matters have already been brought to arbitration (<span class="foreign">πρὸς τῷ διαιτητῇ</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.12</span>; also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 41.28</span>) without a satisfactory conclusion. The plaintiff wants to make it clear that Spudias is of no account and that legal action was forced upon him because of Spudias’ stubbornness. The speech is generally agreed to be an early work of Demosthenes (perhaps before <span class="date">355 BCE</span>) (source for date: <span class="bibl">A.T. Murray, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes II</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 3</span>). Interestingly, archaeologists have found an inscription mentioning <span class="quote_inline">Kleiokrateia, daughter of Polyeuctus of Teithras, and wife of Spudias</span> in the Athenian agora (see <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">Hesperia</span>, vi. [1937], pg. 341</span>).</div>
