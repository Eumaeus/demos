<p>Hypereides son of Glaucippus of the deme Collytus (<span class="date">390/89-322</span>) was a wealthy Athenian with a reputation as a trencherman and patron of high-class prostitutes. He was already influential in Athenian politics when he joined forces with Demosthenes to resist Philip of Macedon. In <span class="date">343</span> Hypereides impeached Philocrates, author of the peace of <span class="date">346</span>, and secured a conviction. In <span class="date">341</span> he went as ambassador to Rhodes, and possibly to Chios, to drum up support against Philip; and in <span class="date">340</span> and <span class="date">339</span> he was active in Athenian naval operations.</p>

<p>Hypereides continued his hard-line anti-Macedonian stance after the loss at Chaeroneia: his speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Philippides’ (2)</span>, for example, attacks an illegal proposal made by Philippides awarding honors to Macedonians. He also found himself repeatedly at odds with Lycurgus, who brought numerous impeachments against Athenian citizens. Two of Hypereides’ surviving speeches (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1 ‘For Lycophron’</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">4 ‘For Euxenippus’</span>) were delivered for the defense in impeachments; in both cases Lycurgus was involved in the prosecution.</p>

<p>Hypereides was appointed one of the special prosecutors in the Harpalus affair; fragments of his speech <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Demosthenes’ (5)</span>, which helped convict his former associate, survive. After the death of Alexander the Great in <span class="date">323</span>, Hypereides led the war party in Athens and traveled abroad to win allies; accordingly, in <span class="date">322</span>, he was chosen to deliver the funeral oration (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">6</span>) in honor of the Athenian dead in the Lamian War. Later that year, after the rebels were defeated, Hypereides was hunted down by order of Antipater and executed. (See also Oratory.)</p>
