<p>Deinarchus son of Sostratus (ca. <span class="date">360-post 292/1</span>) was a <span class="term">metic</span> from Corinth. After studying rhetoric under Theophrastus at the Lyceum, he enjoyed a long and successful career as a speechwriter. He composed speeches for one of the special prosecutors in the Harpalus affair, a scandal in which many prominent Athenians were prosecuted for corruption. His three surviving orations (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1 ‘Against Demosthenes’</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">2 ‘Against Aristogeiton’</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">3 ‘Against Philocles’</span>) come from these trials. The last (and, according to many critics, the least) of the canonical Attic orators, Deinarchus enjoyed the patronage of Demetrius of Phaleron during his decade in power (<span class="date">317-307</span>). When Demetrius I Poliorcetes captured Athens in <span class="date">307</span>, Deinarchus fled to Chalcis, remaining there until Theophrastus arranged his homecoming in <span class="date">292/1</span>. Soon thereafter he brought suit against Proxenus, who hosted him upon his return; the subsequent fate of Deinarchus is unknown. (See also Oratory.)</p>
