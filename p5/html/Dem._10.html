<p>(Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Fourth Philippic</span>, see also Oratory). This speech, if it was ever actually delivered, would have been given at the meeting of the Athenian <span class="term">Assembly</span> sometime in <span class="date">341 BCE</span> or shortly thereafter (after, at least, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 9</span>). But there is good reason to think that this speech is not genuine, but a speech made up in the style of Demosthenes by an imitator or student. The topic is Philip of Macedon’s ongoing aggression against the interests of Athens in northern Greece, particularly Thrace. Several of the passages seem suspiciously similar to passages from other speeches by Demosthenes, especially <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 10.11</span>-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 10.27</span>, which resembles passages from <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 6</span> and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 8</span>, and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 10.55</span>-<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 10.70</span>, which resembles passages from <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 8</span>. It is possible that the orator simply repeated himself, if he was giving yet another speech on a similar topic, but this close repetition might suggest that someone was consciously trying to write a speech in the style of Demosthenes, perhaps as a school exercise (see the genre of Ancient Scholarship. (See also, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 4</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 6</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 9</span>—all speeches urging opposition to Philip, and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 8</span>, which deals with the same political developments in Thrace). </p>
