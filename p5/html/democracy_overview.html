 <div class="Section" id="introduction"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Introduction</span></h2>
 
 <p>The city of Athens lived under a radically democratic
 government from <span class="date">508</span> until <span class="date">322</span> BCE.
 Before the earlier date there was democracy to be found here and there in the government
 of Athens, and democratic institutions survived long
 after the latter date, but for those 186 years the city of Athens was self-consciously and decidedly democratic, autonomous,
 aggressive, and prosperous. Democracy in Athens was
 not limited to giving citizens the right to vote. Athens was not a republic, nor were the People governed by a representative
 body of legislators. In a very real sense, the People governed themselves, debating and
 voting individually on issues great and small, from matters of war and peace to the proper
 qualifications for ferry-boat captains (for the latter, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.157</span>).<span class="note" id="Note1"> [From time to time in this introduction, I cite ancient
 evidence for our knowledge of Athenian democracy and its history. In doing so, I have
 tried to limit myself to sources I know to be available online, in the original language
 and in translation.]</span> The Athenian democracy was not, of course, a free-for-all of
 mob rule. The Athenians understood the value of checks and balances and of enforcing time
 for reflection before acting. They understood that professionalism is necessary in certain
 jobs, that accountability was necessary of most jobs, and that some jobs required absolute
 job-security. The system evolved over time, suffered two complete breakdowns in the <span class="date">5th century</span>, and is certainly open to criticism at many
 points during its history. Nevertheless, it was coherent enough during those two centuries
 that we can describe it, in general terms, without being too far wrong on any point. And
 despite its moments of imprudence, injustice, and indecision, it was an experiment
 remarkable enough to deserve our attention.</p>
 <p>The early history of Athenian Democracy and its development is the subject of <span class="term">another article</span> in this series. This general
 description of how the Athenians governed themselves will focus on the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>, both because the democracy was most fully developed
 during that time and because the majority of our evidence either comes from that period,
 or describes the the Athenian government during that period.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="the_demos"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">The Demos</span></h2>
 
 <p>For the Athenians, ‘democracy’ (<span class="term">demokratia</span>, <span class="foreign">δημοκρατία</span>) gave Rule (<span class="term">kratos</span>, <span class="foreign">κράτος</span>) to the Demos (<span class="foreign">Δῆμος</span>). Demos (pronounced ‘day-moss’) has several
 meanings, all of them important for Athenian democracy. Demos is the Greek word for
 ‘village’ or, as it is often translated, ‘deme.’
 The deme was the smallest administrative unit of the Athenian state, like a voting
 precinct or school district. Young men, who were 18 years old presented themselves to
 officials of their deme and, having proven that they were not slaves, that their parents
 were Athenian, and that they were 18 years old, were enrolled in the ‘<span class="term">Assembly</span> List’ (the <span class="term">pinax
 ekklesiastikos</span>, <span class="foreign">πίναξ ἐκκλησιαστικός</span>) (see
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 44.35</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 42.1</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">Another meaning of Demos, to the Athenians, was ‘People,’ as in the
 People of Athens, the body of citizens collectively.
 So a young man was enrolled in his ‘demos’ (deme), and thus became a
 member of the Demos (the People). As a member of the Demos, this young man could
 participate in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> of Citizens that was the
 central institution of the democracy. The Greek word for ‘
 <span class="term">Assembly</span>
 ’ is <span class="term">ekklesia</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησία</span>), but
 the Athenians generally referred to it as the ‘Demos.’ Decrees of the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span> began with the phrase <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to
 the Demos…,</span> very much like the phrase <span class="quote_inline">We the
 People…</span> that introduces the Constitution of the United States. In this
 context, <span class="quote_inline">Demos</span> was used to make a distinction between the Assembly of all
 citizens and the Council of 500 citizens, another institution of the democracy (see
 below). So some decrees might begin <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the Demos…</span>,
 others might begin <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the Council…</span>, and still
 others might begin, <span class="quote_inline">It seemed best to the Demos and the
 Council….</span></div>
 <p>So the Athenian Demos was the local village, the population generally, and the assembly
 of citizens that governed the state.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="overview"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Athenian Democracy: an Overview</span></h2>
 
 <p>The democratic government of Athens rested on three
 main institutions, and a few others of lesser importance. The three pillars of democracy
 were: the <span class="term">Assembly</span> of the Demos, the <span class="term">Council</span> of 500, and the People’s <span class="term">Court</span>. These were supplemented by the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, the <span class="term">Archons</span>, and
 the <span class="term">Generals</span>. Actual <span class="term">legislation</span> involved both the <span class="term">Assembly</span> and the
 <span class="term">Council</span>, and <span class="foreign">ad hoc</span>
 boards of ‘Lawmakers.’ This summary will describe the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, the <span class="term">Council</span>, and the
 process of <span class="term">legislation</span> in the greatest detail, along
 with a shorter description of the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>. The People’s <span class="term">Court</span> will be
 covered briefly and then left for fuller treatment in other resources. While <span class="term">Generals</span> and <span class="term">Archons</span> will
 appear here and there in the descriptions of other institutions, they were really servants
 of the Demos and do not require extensive discussion in this relatively brief introduction
 to Athenian Democracy.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="assembly"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">Athenian Democracy: the <span class="term">Assembly</span></span></h2>
 
 <p>The <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="term">Ekklesia</span>, <span class="foreign">ἐκκλησία</span>) was the regular gathering of male Athenian citizens
 (women also enjoyed a certain citizen status, but without political rights) to listen to,
 discuss, and vote on decrees that affected every aspect of Athenian life, both public and
 private, from financial matters to religious ones, from public festivals to war, from
 treaties with foreign powers to regulations governing ferry boats.</p>
 <p>The <span class="term">Assembly</span> was the regular opportunity for all male
 citizens of Athens to speak their minds and exercise
 their votes regarding the government of their city. It was the most central and most
 definitive institution of the Athenian Democracy. Before <span class="date">462</span>
 BCE, the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> controlled <span class="term">legislation</span> in Athens,
 but in that year Ephialtes instituted a reform that diminished
 the power of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> and increased the power of the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span> of the people (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.2</span>;
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 27.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
 15.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span>
 9.5</span>). This <span class="term">Assembly</span> became synonymous with
 democracy. When Aristotle describes how democratic
 government was restored, after Sparta defeated
 Athens in <span class="date">404</span> BCE, he says
 that this restoration happened when the People (<span class="term">Demos</span>, <span class="foreign">Δῆμος</span>) became sovereign over affairs (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.1</span>).
 Under this government, he says, the People administers all business by decrees and by
 <span class="term">law-courts</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.2</span>).
 When Aristotle mentions the <span class="term">People</span> and government by decrees, he is describing the <span class="term">Assembly</span>.</p>
 <div class="p">In the <span class="term">Assembly</span> each male citizen of Athens could speak, regardless of his station. The orator Aeschines says that <blockquote class="quote"><p>the herald, acting as a
 sergeant-at-arms, does not exclude from the platform the man whose ancestors have not
 held a general’s office, nor even the man who earns his daily bread by working
 at a trade; nay, these men he most heartily welcomes, and for this reason he repeats
 again and again the invitation, <span class="quote_inline">Who wishes to address the <span class="term">Assembly</span>?</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.27</span>) The orator Demosthenes could scold his fellow Athenians for failing to
 recollect certain events, because they <span class="quote_inline">were present at every <span class="term">Assembly</span>, as the state proposed a discussion of policy in
 which every one might join</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 18.273</span>). <span class="quote_inline">Everyone,</span> in this context, refers to the body of citizens
 who were registered on the <span class="term">Assembly</span> List for their local
 Deme (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 44.35</span>). Under the Democracy
 of Aristotle’s time (after <span class="date">330</span> BCE), young men were enrolled on this list when they were 18 years old
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 42.1</span>), then spent two years as military cadets, or <span class="term">ephebes</span>, <span class="foreign">ἔφηβοι</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 42.4</span>), after which they were members of the
 citizen body (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 42.5</span>).</div>
 <div class="p">Of course, some people might be better qualified than others to speak on certain
 subjects, and the citizens of Athens could be very
 critical when anyone tried to speak outside of his expertise. The character Socrates in Plato’s
 <span class="titlem">Protagoras</span> says that <blockquote class="quote"><p>when the Athenian <span class="term">Assembly</span> is discussing construction, the citizens call for builders to speak,
 and when it is discussing the construction of ships they call for shipwrights, but if
 anyone else, whom the people do not regard as a craftsman, attempts to advise them, no
 matter how handsome and wealthy and well-born he may be, not one of these things induces
 them to accept him; they merely laugh him to scorn and shout him down, until either the
 speaker retires from his attempt, overborne by the clamor, or the <span class="term">Archers</span> pull him from his place or turn him out
 altogether by order of the presiding officials</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Prot.</span> 319b</span> - <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Prot.</span> 319c</span>). But,
 Socrates continues, when the discussion is not about
 technical matters but about the governing of the city, the man who rises to advise them on
 this may equally well be a smith, a shoemaker, a merchant, a sea-captain, a rich man, a
 poor man, of good family or of none (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat.
 <span class="titlem">Prot.</span> 319d</span>).</div>
 <p>There is the question of participation by Athenians living in the countryside of
 Attica, outside the city of Athens. While these people were certainly citizens of Athens, it may often have been difficult for them to attend a
 meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. This would have been especially
 true when emergency meetings were called on short notice, such as the occasion when news
 of a military disaster came to the city in the evening, and a special <span class="term">Assembly</span> convened the very next morning (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.169</span>). This <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and any others like it, must have consisted mainly
 of citizens living close to the city. And even when there was more warning before a
 meeting, we have to wonder how many Athenians living in the countryside of Attica would have made a 50 or 60 mile journey to downtown
 Athens and back. In the <span class="date">5th century</span> we can estimate the adult male population of Athens, and thus the number of men eligible to participate in
 an <span class="term">Assembly</span>, to have been 40,000 - 60,000, and in the
 <span class="date">4th century</span>, 20,000 - 30,000. But the number of
 Athenians in attendance at a given meeting seems to have been considerably lower. Thucydides makes the statement that during the Peloponnesian
 War (<span class="date">331 - 404 BCE</span>) there were usually only 5000
 people at a meeting (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.72</span>),
 although he may be exaggerating downwards; a better measure of regular attendance might be
 the fact that 6000 citizens were required for a valid vote conferring <span class="term">citizenship</span> on a non-Athenian (the earliest evidence for
 this rule dates from <span class="date">369</span> BCE) (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 103</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.45</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.89</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">When the <span class="term">Assembly</span> met, the male citizens assembled to
 discuss the affairs of the city, and this discussion required that each citizen have
 freedom to speak his mind. This freedom was vital to the proper functioning of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, whether the issue at stake was some important public
 policy (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 15.1</span>), or the rights of a
 single citizen (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.3</span>). In an
 anecdote from the distant past, Demosthenes suggests
 that freedom of speech had a long history at Athens,
 and persisted despite periodic attempts to limit it. He recounts how in the <span class="date">6th century</span> BCE the island of Salamis had revolted from Athenian control, and the Athenians had forbidden
 anyone even to propose a war to recover the island; but Solon,
 a real person whose place in Athenian history became subject of legend, composed a poem on
 the subject (poetry on the subject was evidently not forbidden), and through this ruse got
 around the law and convinced Athens to fight for
 Salamis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.252</span>). By the <span class="date">4th century</span> BCE, discussions of motions in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> were opened with a general invitation to all the male
 citizens, as the Herald asked, <span class="quote_inline">Who wishes to speak?</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.191</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.26</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Ach.</span> 46</span>). We
 might note, here, that Demosthenes claims a certain
 freedom of speech to have extended even to resident foreigners and slaves (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 9.3</span>), although he is certainly not
 talking about participation in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and we should
 wonder how much freedom these people actually enjoyed.</div>
 <p>This freedom to speak was not absolute or without regulation. Aeschines tells us, for example, that in the early democracy (before the <span class="date">5th century</span>) citizens over 50 years of age could speak
 first, and only after those had their say could younger men speak (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.23</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.2</span>). Other formal restrictions
 could apply, such as decrees limiting discussion of certain topics to certain meetings of
 the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.109</span>), or even laws forbidding
 discussion of issues already settled in a <span class="term">court</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.54</span>). Other, less legitimate (but
 perhaps more effective) limits could be imposed: the crowd might raise a clamor and refuse
 to listen to a speaker advocate an unpopular proposal (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.111</span>), and this seems to have
 happened often enough that orators regularly asked, beforehand, not to be shouted down
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 13.14</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">Individual citizens could lose the right to participate in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> by committing various offenses (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.23</span>). Demosthenes mentions legal penalties for people who attend a meeting of the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span> while owing a debt to the public treasury
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.123</span>), or who have been
 stricken, for some reason or another, from their deme’s register of citizens
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.132</span>). Also prohibited from
 participating were: anyone convicted of prostituting himself (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.72</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.21</span>; and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.32</span>, where the orator adds,
 <span class="quote_inline">however well he speaks</span>), anyone who beat his father or mother, or failed
 to support them, or who threw away his shield in battle, or who squandered his inheritance
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.28</span> - <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.30</span>). Any citizen who suspected
 another of being unqualified to participate in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could challenge him to <span class="term">dokimasia</span>, or
 ‘scrutiny’ (<span class="foreign">δοκιμασία</span>), whereupon
 the issue would be decided by a <span class="term">jury</span> in a <span class="term">law-court</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.32</span>).</div>
 <p>Citizens were paid for attending the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, to ensure
 that even the poor could afford to take time from their work to participate in their own
 government. Aristotle recognized that inclusion of all
 citizens and freedom to speak are not the only hallmarks of a democratic constitution, but
 that the most democratic states pay their citizens for attending the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. He claims that in the absence of payment, the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="term">Boule</span>, <span class="foreign">Βουλή</span>) is the most democratic of magistracies (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1317b</span>),
 but in states that can afford to, and do, pay their citizens for attending meetings of the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span>, all the citizens actually take part in it and
 exercise their <span class="term">citizenship</span>, because even the poor are
 enabled to be at leisure by receiving pay (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1293a</span>). A historical anecdote recorded in Aristotle’s <span class="titlem">Constitution of the
 Athenians</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span></span>) further supports this assertion: In <span class="date">411</span>, when a group of Athenians temporarily overthrew the democracy and established
 an oligarchy, one of their first acts was to pass a law that no one should receive pay for
 political activity (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 29.5</span>; and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 33.1</span>, referring to the subsequent regime of <span class="date">411</span> and <span class="date">410</span>). In the <span class="date">4th century</span>, when Timocrates had proposed
 that the Athenians loosen enforcement of penalties against those who owe debts to the
 state, Demosthenes claimed that there would be no money
 left in the treasury to pay for attendance at the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and he went on to equate that outcome with an end to Democracy (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.99</span>).</p>
 <p>The traditional meeting-place for the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was the
 open space on top of the hill of the Pnyx (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 8.97</span>). The Pnyx was open to the sky, and thus meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> must have been influenced by the weather; the laws
 that mandated good weather omens before the election of military officers (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.4</span>)
 might have been as interested in ensuring a comfortable day for discussion as in
 ascertaining divine favor. </p>
 <p>In the <span class="date">4th century</span>, there were 40 regularly
 scheduled meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> each year, four in each
 ‘prytany’ (a ‘prytany’ was an administrative unit
 equal to one tenth of the year) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.3</span>).</p>
 <p>One of the four meetings in each prytany was the Sovereign <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="term">kuria ekklesia</span>, <span class="foreign">κυρία
 ἐκκλησία</span>), the agenda for which included the confirmation of magistrates
 currently serving, issues of the food supply and defense, announcements of private
 property to be confiscated, and announcements of lawsuits regarding inheritance (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 43.4</span>).</p>
 <p>In each prytany, there were three regular assemblies in addition to the Sovereign <span class="term">Assembly</span>; these were simply called Assemblies (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.3</span>).
 It seems likely that in the <span class="date">5th century</span> only the
 Sovereign Assemblies were regularly scheduled, because Thucydides mentions a period of 40 days in the year <span class="date">431</span> in which there was no <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 2.22.1</span>); if there were four
 scheduled assemblies in each prytany at that time, 40 days could not have passed without a
 meeting.</p>
 <p>Apart from the Sovereign <span class="term">Assembly</span>, one of the remaining
 three was an occasion for any citizen who wished to present a suppliant-branch and address
 his fellow citizens about any public or private matter that concerned him (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.6</span>).
 The ability of citizens to voice complaints in this public forum may have deterred certain
 bad behavior, or at least made the perpetrators think twice. Aeschines recounts how on one occasion some men assaulted a man named Pittalacus. On the next day when Pittalacus was in the marketplace, his attackers came up to him and tried to
 assuage him; they were afraid that their crime would be published to the whole city, since
 there was to be an <span class="term">Assembly</span> that day (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.60</span>).</p>
 <p>The other two regularly scheduled meetings in each prytany were concerned, according to
 Aristotle, with other things (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.6</span>).
 Some of this other business was scheduled to happen at particular assemblies during the
 year. At an <span class="term">Assembly</span> held on the 11th day of the first
 prytany, the people voted on whether or not to hold an review of all the laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>). In the 6th prytany, there was
 discussion of whether or not to hold an <span class="term">ostracism</span>,
 discussion of any information against people charged with being informers—in
 this category, no more than three citizens and three resident foreigners—and
 discussion of people accused of failing to perform some assigned public service (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.5</span>).
 A meeting during the 6th prytany was also the occasion for election of military officers
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 44.4</span>).</p>
 <p>At least until the middle of the <span class="date">4th century</span> the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span> occasionally met to conduct a trial, most often
 an <span class="term">impeachment</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 49.10</span>).</p>
 <p>Assemblies do not seem to have taken place on fixed days during each prytany, but they
 did not happen on days when the <span class="term">law-courts</span> were in session
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.80</span>). They seem also to have
 been scheduled around other important events, such as religious festivals. Aeschines is highly critical of an <span class="term">Assembly</span> that was called on the 8th day of the month Elaphobolion, a day of
 sacrifices to Asclepius (the orator says that this was
 unprecedented in memory) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin.
 3.67</span>), and Demosthenes criticizes a motion to
 have the <span class="term">Assembly</span> meet on the 12th of the month
 Hecatombaion, a festival day for Cronus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.26</span>).</p>
 <p>In addition to Sovereign Assemblies (<span class="term">kuriai ekklesiai</span>) and Assemblies
 (<span class="term">ekklesiai</span>), there were Called-together Assemblies (<span class="term">sunkletoi
 ekklesiai</span>, <span class="foreign">σύγκλητοι ἐκκλησίαι</span>); the term
 appears only in literary evidence (not in inscriptions) during the <span class="date">4th century</span>, and its meaning is not entirely clear. Sometimes our
 sources seem to use it to refer to extra meetings, in addition to the normal four that
 happened in each prytany. Aeschines mentions a time when
 Athens was in such a panic over Philip of Macedon’s war against
 Amphipolis, that there were more Called-together
 Assemblies than scheduled Assemblies (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.72</span>). But at other times the term seems to indicate an <span class="term">Assembly</span> called at short notice, but not necessarily an extra
 <span class="term">Assembly</span>.</p>
 <p>Officials of the <span class="term">Council</span> called together a meeting of the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span>, which opened with various religious rituals
 before the citizens were invited to speak and vote on matters of public business.</p>
 <p>The 50 members of the <span class="term">Council</span> serving as
 Prytaneis—the same word, <span class="term">prytaneis</span> (<span class="foreign">πρυτάνεις</span>) refers to the governmental months, ten each year, and to the
 members of the <span class="term">Council</span> who were presiding during a given
 prytany—normally called meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 43.3</span>), and posted the agenda beforehand (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.4</span>).
 If the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was to vote on some matter by ballot, the
 Prytaneis distribute the ballots (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 59.90</span>).</p>
 <p>In the <span class="date">5th century</span>, the Prytaneis actually managed
 the conduct of a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.14</span>), but
 in Aristotle’s time (after the middle of the
 <span class="date">4th century</span>), the President of the <span class="term">Council</span> appointed nine Proedroi for each <span class="term">Assembly</span>; these were chosen from members of the <span class="term">Council</span> who were not currently serving as Prytaneis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.2</span>).
 These Proedroi managed the conduct of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>;
 deciding when to put a question to the vote (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.84</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin.
 2.68</span>), and deciding when to cut off discussion of a matter (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.67</span>).</p>
 <p>The People did, on occasion, override the will of the officials conducting the meetings,
 as when, in the late <span class="date">5th century</span>, the Prytaneis were
 unwilling to allow a vote, the People overrode them with menacing shouts (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.14</span>).</p>
 <p>The selection or appointment of Proedroi was potentially subject to corruption, which
 Aeschines hints at on two occasions (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.73</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.90</span>). In addition to these
 Proedroi, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> elected a clerk
 (<span class="term">grammateus</span>, <span class="foreign">γραμματεύς</span>) to read
 documents aloud (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 54.5</span>); the orator Aeschines
 served as a clerk early in his career, although we do not know whether he was the clerk
 appointed to read in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.79</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">The opening of a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was marked by
 rituals. A sacrifice was made and carried around the area, and there was a prayer, both of
 these intended to purify the proceedings (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.23</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin.
 2.158</span>; a parody of this prayer is found at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span> 314</span>). The
 heralds offered the prayer (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin.
 1.23</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>). The herald
 also called down curses (<span class="term">kataratai</span>, <span class="foreign">καταρᾶται</span>) on anyone who would mislead the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.70</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.97</span>; there is a parody of this at
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span>
 335</span>). After these rituals, the Herald asked <span class="quote_inline">Who wishes to speak?,</span>
 and the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was opened (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.191</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.26</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Ach.</span> 46</span>; cf. a
 possible parody of this at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph.
 <span class="titlem">Eccl.</span> 130</span>).</div>
 <div class="p">Most voting in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> was by a show of hands
 (<span class="term">cheirotonia</span>, <span class="foreign">χειροτονία</span>), although some
 votes were conducted by secret ballot (<span class="term">psephos</span>, <span class="foreign">ψῆφος</span>, literally ‘pebble’). Even the most serious of
 matters were often decided by show of hands, such as the <span class="term">impeachment</span> and condemnation of <span class="term">generals</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 34.1</span>)
 and the approval of formal laws (<span class="term">nomoi</span>, <span class="foreign">νόμοι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>)
 (laws were more significant than decrees; see below). This method of voting limited the
 business of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to daylight hours, as this
 anecdote from Xenophon shows: <blockquote class="quote"><p>It was decided,
 however, that the matter should be postponed to another meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (for by that time it was late in the day and they
 could not have distinguished the hands in the voting).</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.7</span>). Under
 certain circumstances, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> would vote by ballot
 (<span class="term">psephos</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen.
 <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.9</span>). Voting by ballot was limited to issues which had
 to be decided by a quorum of 6000 citizens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.89</span> - <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 59.90</span>).</div>
 <p>Once the <span class="term">Assembly</span> had approved something, the decree, its
 date, and the names of the officials who put the matter to the vote, were recorded and
 preserved as a public record of the proceedings of government (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.89</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.58</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.75</span>).</p>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="council"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">Athenian Democracy: the <span class="term">Council</span></span></h2>
 
 <p>The <span class="term">Council</span> of 500 represented the full-time government of
 Athens. It consisted of 500 citizens, 50 from each
 of the ten tribes, who served for one year. The <span class="term">Council</span>
 could issue decrees on its own, regarding certain matters, but its main function was to
 prepare the agenda for meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The <span class="term">Council</span> would meet to discuss and vote on ‘Preliminary
 decrees’ (<span class="term">probouleumata</span>, <span class="foreign">προβουλεύματα</span>), and any of these that passed the <span class="term">Council</span>’s vote went on for discussion and voting in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>.</p>
 <p>Each member of the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="term">boule</span>, <span class="foreign">βουλή</span>) was a Councilor (<span class="term">bouleutes</span>, <span class="foreign">βουλευτής</span>, in the plural, <span class="term">bouleutai</span>) (see for
 example <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.104</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 2.14</span>). Aristotle lists service on the <span class="term">Council</span> among
 those offices chosen by lot (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 62.1</span>). He elsewhere says that in a democratic city,
 the <span class="term">Council</span> was the most important board of magistrates
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span>
 1322b</span>). Through most of the <span class="date">5th</span> and <span class="date">4th</span> centures BCE, citizens were paid for their
 participation in the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 62.2</span>),
 and each citizen could serve on the <span class="term">Council</span> twice in his
 lifetime (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 62.3</span>).</p>
 <p>Although participation in the <span class="term">Council</span> was paid, and
 considered an office, it also seems to have been considered an unexceptional part of a
 citizen’s life, rather than a part of a political career. In Plato’s <span class="titlem">Apology of Socrates</span> (an
 account, perhaps largely fictional, of the speech Socrates gave
 when on trial for impiety), Socrates says that he served on the
 <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Apol.</span> 32a-b</span>),
 but also says that he never participated in politics (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Apol.</span> 31c-d</span>).
 So, in <span class="titlem">Plato</span>’s account, it seems that service on the <span class="term">Council</span> did not indicate political ambition, or even any
 special interest in politics.</p>
 <p>Before taking their seats on the <span class="term">Council</span>, newly selected
 Councilors had to undergo scrutiny (<span class="term">dokimasia</span>), an audit of their fitness to
 serve (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 45.3</span>).</p>
 <p>Lysias makes the claim that the law of scrutiny was
 primarily intended to deny political office to men who had participated in one of the
 short-lived oligarchic coups of the <span class="date">5th century</span> BCE,
 or the <span class="term">Tyranny of the Thirty</span> (these events are
 discussed above) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.9-10</span>). But
 scrutiny was a broadly important institution in the Athenian democracy, and Lysias’ statement is probably too narrow to
 reflect strictly historical reality.</p>
 <p>The Nine <span class="term">Archons</span> underwent scrutiny before taking office
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 55.2</span>), as did the ten <span class="term">generals</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 15.1-2</span>), as did priests, advocates,
 heralds, and ambassadors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin.
 1.19-20</span>). In fact, according to Aeschines, any
 citizen could call upon any other citizen to undergo scrutiny at any time, to determine
 whether he deserved the privilege of speaking before the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.32</span>).
 Furthermore, every young Athenian man underwent a scrutiny before the members of his deme
 before he was enrolled in the list of citizens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 44.41</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.21</span>).</p>
 <p>The scrutiny of newly selected Councilors was managed by the Thesmothetae, the lower six
 of the nine <span class="term">archons</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 59.4</span>),
 but it was the outgoing <span class="term">Council</span> that decided whether each
 of the 500 new Councilors was eligible to take office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 45.3</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">This scrutiny took into account almost every aspect of a citizen’s life, public
 and private, and we can learn much about the values of the Athenian democracy from the
 questions asked during a scrutiny, and grounds for which a candidate could fail his
 scrutiny. According to Aristotle, a candidate for the
 <span class="term">Council</span> was asked, <blockquote class="quote"><p>Who is your father and to what
 deme does he belong, and who is your father’s father, and who your mother, and
 who her father and what his deme? Then whether he has a Family Apollo and Homestead Zeus, and where these shrines
 are; then whether he has family tombs and where they are; then whether he treats his
 parents well, and whether he pays his taxes, and whether he has done his military
 service</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.3-4</span>). According to Xenophon, they were also asked if they honored their family graves (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 2.2.13</span>).</div>
 <div class="p">After the candidate answered the questions, and any accusers had come forward, the <span class="term">Council</span> voted by show of hands (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.4</span>).
 According to Aristotle, originally the vote of the <span class="term">Council</span> was the last word in a scrutiny, but in his time (the
 middle of the <span class="date">4th century</span> BCE) <span class="quote_inline">there is an
 appeal to the <span class="term">Jury-court</span>, and with this rests the final
 decision as to qualification</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 55.2</span>).</div>
 <p>A passage from a speech by Lysias confirms that a
 candidate who was rejected by the <span class="term">Council</span> could appeal to a
 <span class="term">jury</span>, while noting that this appeal could take time, and
 might result in the year beginning without a full body of magistrates in office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.6</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">The newly appointed Councilors swore an oath, the terms of which are preserved by passing
 mentions in various sources. According to Xenophon, they
 swore <span class="quote_inline">to advise according to the laws</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 1.1.18</span>).
 According to two passages from Lysias, they swore
 <span class="quote_inline">to advise what was best for the city</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 31.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 30.10</span>). Demosthenes mentions Councilors swearing <span class="quote_inline">to advise what was best for the
 People</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.4</span>), and this:
 <blockquote class="quote"><p>Nor will I imprison any Athenian citizen who provides three people to guarantee
 his debt, guarantors who are in the same tax-bracket, except anyone found guilty of
 conspiring to betray the city or to subvert the democracy, or anyone who has contracted
 to collect taxes, or his guarantor, or his collector who is in default</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.144</span>). A passage from a speech
 attributed to Andocides claims that the <span class="quote_inline">oath of
 the <span class="term">People</span> and the <span class="term">Council</span></span> included a promise <span class="quote_inline">not to exile, nor imprison, nor
 execute anyone without a trial</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 4.3</span>). According to Lysias, again,
 Councilors swore an oath, <span class="quote_inline">to let it be known if he knows of anyone who has been
 selected by lot but is not fit to serve on the <span class="term">Council</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 31.2</span>),
 and <span class="quote_inline">to crown a man as worthy of public office only after scrutinizing him</span>
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.8</span>).</div>
 <p>Five hundred Councilors served on the <span class="term">Council</span> for the
 year, but practical concerns required that they be divided into smaller groups.
 Accordingly, the legislative year was divided into ten parts, each called a
 ‘prytany’; for each prytany, the fifty Councilors from one of the ten
 tribes served as ‘presidents,’ or prytanes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 43.2-3</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">The order in which the Councilors from each tribe served as presidents was random,
 determined by lot (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 43.2</span>). The random determination seems to have taken place at the
 end of each prytany (rather than all at once at the beginning of the year), so no one
 could predict which tribe would serve next. An inscription makes reference to <span class="quote_inline">the
 presidents, whichever ones might hold that position after the tribe of Oineis</span> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span>
 II2 553.16-17</span>). When the decree was written, the Councilors
 from the tribe of Oineis were serving as prytanes, or
 presidents; the decree needed to refer to the next group of presidents, but that group was
 clearly not known. So, we can infer from this that the selection must have happened toward
 the end of a prytany. Obviously, during the ninth prytany of the year, it would be obvious
 that whichever tribe had not yet served would hold the presidency for the final
 prytany.</div>
 <p>This elaborate randomization of the presidency was probably intended to limit
 possibilities for corruption. No one could plan to introduce business to the <span class="term">Council</span> when a particular tribe held the presidency, and no
 Councilor could know in advance when he would serve as a president.</p>
 <p>The presidents ate their meals together in the Tholos, the ‘Round
 House.’ They planned and organized meetings of the <span class="term">Council</span> and posted an agenda for each meeting beforehand (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 43.3</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">Aristotle tells us that <blockquote class="quote"><p>There is a chairman of
 the presidents, one man, chosen by lot; this man chairs for a night and a
 day—no longer—and cannot become chairman a second time</p></blockquote>
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 44.1</span>). This chairman kept the keys to the treasuries and archives of Athens, as well as the state seal (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 44.1</span>).</div>
 <p>In addition to a daily meeting of all the presidents, the chairman and one third of the
 presidents were required to be on hand in the Tholos constantly (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.1</span>); presumably only the chairman was on duty for a
 full 24 hours, and the other presidents could divide the day into 8 hour shifts. These
 men, on-call in the Tholos, represented the
 whole government of Athens in a time of crisis, at
 least until the full <span class="term">Council</span> or <span class="term">Assembly</span> could be convened. Heralds and envoys from other states came to the
 presidents in the Tholos first, as did
 messenger bearing official letters (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.6</span>).</p>
 <p>Demosthenes describes a dramatic scene, that shows
 clearly the function of the presidents and the chairman. In <span class="date">339</span>
 BCE, Philip of Macedon
 marched his army south and captured the city of Elateia, thus threatening Thebes and
 the Thebans’ southern neighbor, Athens.
 Demosthenes describes what happened when news of this
 threat came to Athens:</p>
 <div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>Evening had already fallen when a messenger arrived bringing to the presiding
 councilors the news that Elateia had been taken.
 They were sitting at supper, but they instantly rose from table, cleared the booths in
 the marketplace of their occupants, and
 unfolded the hurdles, while others summoned the commanders and ordered the attendance of
 the trumpeter. The commotion spread through the whole city. At daybreak on the next day
 the presidents summoned the <span class="term">Council</span> to the Council House, and the citizens flocked to
 the place of assembly. Before the <span class="term">Council</span> could introduce
 the business and prepare the agenda, the whole body of citizens had taken their places
 on the hill. The <span class="term">Council</span> arrived, the presiding Councilors formally reported the intelligence
 they had received, and the courier was introduced</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.169-170</span>).</div>
 <p>So, in a crisis, the safety of Athens lay first in
 the hands of the presidents and the chairman. It is worth noting that because there were
 354 days in the legislative year (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 43.2</span>), more than two thirds of all Councilors would
 serve as chairman for a night and a day in a given year.</p>
 <p>There are further implications, if we accept the estimate of two scholars that in <span class="date">400</span> BCE there were approximately 22,000 adult male
 citizens—it is beyond the scope of this article to give evidence and
 justification for this, but the arguments are presented in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Victor
 Ehrenberg, <span class="titlem">The Greek State</span>, 2nd English Edition (Methuen, 1969)
 31</span>, whose estimate is 20,000-25,000, and in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">A.W. Gomme, <span class="titlem">The Population of Athens in the
 Fifth and Fourth Centuries BC</span> (Blackwell, 1933) 26</span>, whose estimate is
 22,000.</p>
 <p>A citizen had to be 30 years old to serve as a Councilor (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Mem.</span> 1.2.35</span>). For
 the sake of argument, we might assume that the average citizen would then have an active
 political life of 30 years, until he was 60. During that time, there would need to be
 approximately 10,000 chairmen, each controlling the state seal and the treasuries, and
 presiding over the presidents of the <span class="term">Council</span> for a day and
 a night (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 44.1</span>). Since no one could serve as chairman twice (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 44.1</span>),
 this office would have to go to 10,000 different Athenians. It follows, then, that
 approximately one half of all Athenian citizens would, at some point during their lives,
 have the privilege and responsibility of holding this office, arguably the closest
 equivalent to a Chief Executive in the Athenian democracy.</p>
 <p>More important than any other function of the <span class="term">Council</span> was
 its role in preparing the agenda for meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, where all Athenian citizens gathered to discuss and vote on
 decrees.</p>
 <p>While any male citizen was invited to speak in an <span class="term">Assembly</span> and all male citizens could vote, the topics for discussion and vote
 were limited by what amounted to a system of checks and balances between the <span class="term">Assembly</span> and the <span class="term">Council</span>.</p>
 <div class="p">The <span class="term">Council</span> would vote on preliminary decrees
 (<span class="term">probouleumata</span>, or in the singular, <span class="term">probouleuma</span>, <span class="foreign">προβούλευμα</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.92</span>). According to the <span class="date">10th century
 CE</span> lexicon of the Greek language, the <span class="titlem">Suda</span>, a probouleuma was
 <span class="quote_inline">What has been voted on by the <span class="term">Council</span> before being
 presented to the <span class="term">People</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Suda pi,2349</span>). A passage from the
 orator Demosthenes’ speech against Neaira illustrates how a probouleuma worked:</div>
 <div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>You were at that time on the point of sending your entire force to Euboea and Olynthus,
 and Apollodorus, being one of its members, brought forward in
 the <span class="term">Council</span> a motion, and carried it as a preliminary
 decree (probouleuma) to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, proposing that the
 people should decide whether the funds remaining over from the state’s
 expenditure should be used for military purposes or for public spectacles. For the laws
 prescribed that, when there was war, the funds remaining over from state expenditures
 should be devoted to military purposes, and Apollodorus
 believed that the people ought to have power to do what they pleased with their own; and
 he had sworn that, as a member of the senate, he would act for the best interests of the
 Athenian people, as you all bore witness at that crisis</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.4</span>).</div>
 <p>In this case, an existing law required that any surplus funds in the treasury of
 Athens should be used for military purposes. But
 despite this law, Apollodorus wanted the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to discuss how to spend the funds. So Apollodorus brought the matter to the <span class="term">Council</span>, which voted to create a preliminary decree. The <span class="term">council</span> approved the preliminary decree. This preliminary decree allowed the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span> to discuss how to spend the money. Demosthenes goes on to say that the <span class="term">Assembly</span> voted, unanimously, to spend the money on the military (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.5</span>).</p>
 <p>So, after this lengthy procedure, the Athenian democracy did with its money precisely
 what an existing law required. But the mechanism of the <span class="term">Council</span>, its probouleuma, and the <span class="term">Assembly</span>
 allowed all of the citizens to deliberate, in an orderly manner, on the extent to which
 the existing law was appropriate under these circumstances, a war in Euboea and around Olynthus.</p>
 <p>An inscription that survives in fairly good condition illustrates vividly the course of
 an actual motion through the <span class="term">Council</span>, to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> by means of a preliminary decree, and into the body
 of Athenian policy as a decree of the Athenian People. This inscription dates from around
 <span class="date">333</span> BCE, and has to do with a request by some merchants from
 the city of Citium on the island of Cyprus; these merchants came to the Athenian <span class="term">Council</span> to ask for permission to build a temple to Aphrodite, Cyprus’
 patron goddess, where natives of Cyprus could worship
 while they were visiting or living in Athens (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2 337</span>).</p>
 <p>It is important to note that the text and translation given here omit any indication of
 how the inscription actually looked, and the extent to which modern editors have filled in
 missing sections; what appears here is considerably cleaned up. It can serve to illustrate
 the workings of the <span class="term">Council</span>, but should not be taken as
 indicative of the proper way to present and read an inscription.</p>
 <p>Here is the inscription, <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span> II2
 337</span> [By the way, it makes reference to <span class="term">Proedroi</span>, <span class="foreign">Πρόεδροι</span>; these were the Councilors selected to run meetings
 of either the <span class="term">Council</span> or the <span class="term">Assembly</span>]:</p>
 <div class="p">
 <blockquote class="quote"><p>Gods. When Nikokratos was archon, in the first prytany
 (that of the tribe Aegeis): Theophilos from the deme Phegous, one of the
 Proedroi, put this matter to the vote: The <span class="term">Council</span>
 decided (after Antidotos, son of Apollodoros, from the deme Sypalettos made the
 motion): Concerning the things that the Citians say
 about the foundation of the temple to Aphrodite, it has been
 voted by the <span class="term">Council</span> that the Proedroi, the ones to be
 chosen by lot to serve as Proedroi at the first <span class="term">Assembly</span>, should introduce the Citians and
 allow them to have an audience, and to share with the <span class="term">People</span> the opinion of the <span class="term">Council</span>, that the
 <span class="term">People</span>, having heard from the Citians concerning the foundation of the temple, and from any other
 Athenian who wants to speak, decide to do whatever seems best. When Nikokrates was archon, in the second Prytany (that of the tribe Pandionis): Phanostratos from the deme

 the <span class="term">People</span> to give to the merchants of the Citians the use of a plot of land on which they might build a
 temple of Aphrodite, just as also the Egyptians built the temple
 of Isis.</p></blockquote>
 </div>
 <p>On this one inscription we see the whole legislative process. In the first prytany of the
 year, Antidotos, a councilor, made a motion before the <span class="term">Council</span> regarding this request by the Citians. One of the
 Proedroi in charge of running the meeting of the <span class="term">Council</span>
 put the matter to a vote. The <span class="term">Council</span> voted to send the
 matter along to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> without making any
 recommendation to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> for or against the
 Citians’ request. Then, in the second
 Prytany, Lykourgos, made a motion in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The motion was in favor of the Citians’
 request, and it was put to the vote by Phanostratos, a
 Councilor serving as one of the Proedroi who were in charge of running the meeting of the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The People voted on the matter, and the
 Citians were allowed to build their temple, just as
 (evidently) some Egyptians had been allowed to build a
 temple to Isis.</p>

 <div class="Section" id="legislation"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">Athenian Democracy: <span class="term">Legislation</span></span></h2>
 
 <p>Athenians in the <span class="date">4th century</span> were governed by laws
 (<span class="term">nomoi</span> or <span class="term">nomos</span>, <span class="foreign">νόμος</span>, in
 the singular) and decrees (<span class="term">psephismata</span>, or <span class="term">psephisma</span>, <span class="foreign">ψήφισμα</span>, in the singular). Decrees were passed by a vote of
 the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, of the <span class="term">Council</span>, or both. Laws came into being by a more complicated process. Laws took
 precedence over Decrees. Anyone who proposed a decree in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> that contradicted an existing law was subject to prosecution on a
 charge of ‘Illegal Proposal’ (<span class="term">
 <span class="term">graphe paranomon</span>
 </span>, <span class="foreign">γραφὴ παρανόμων</span>). Laws were passed through a
 process called <span class="term">nomothesia</span> (<span class="foreign">νομοθεσία</span>) or
 ‘<span class="term">legislation</span>.’ Each year the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span> met to discuss the current body of laws. Any
 citizen could propose a change in the laws, but could only propose the repeal of a law if
 he suggested another law to replace the repealed law. If the <span class="term">Assembly</span> decided to change the laws, a board of ‘Nomothetai’
 or ‘legislators’ was selected to review and revise the laws. The
 process of <span class="term">legislation</span> was like a trial, with advocates
 speaking in defense of the existing laws, and others speaking against the existing laws.
 The Nomothetai would vote on changes, and any changes that passed were published on
 inscriptions near the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous
 Heroes</span> and read aloud at the next meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The Nomothetai also undertook an annual review of all existing laws,
 to make sure that none contradicted others, and that none were redundant.</p>
 <div class="p">To understand <span class="term">legislation</span> under the Athenian
 democracy, it is necessary to understand some terms. The Athenians of the <span class="date">5th century</span> BCE seem to have used two words
 interchangeably to refer to what we call a ‘law,’
 <span class="term">nomos</span> and <span class="term">psephisma</span>. In the <span class="date">4th
 century</span> these words had two distinct meanings: a <span class="term">nomos</span> was a
 ‘law,’ while a <span class="term">psephisma</span> was a
 ‘decree.’ For the <span class="date">5th century</span>
 usage, we have the historian Xenophon and his account of
 a speech that Euryptolemus gave before the <span class="term">Assembly</span> in <span class="date">406</span>. The speaker tells
 his audience that, in a particular case, either the psephisma of Kannonus applies (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen.
 <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.20</span>), or the psephisma regarding temple-robbers and
 traitors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span>
 1.7.21</span>); he then refers to both of these psephismata as
 ‘nomoi’ (the plural form of ‘nomos’) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Xen. <span class="titlem">Hell.</span> 1.7.22</span>). So
 it would seem that these two terms were more-or-less equivalent. In the <span class="date">4th century</span>, however, these two terms clearly referred to two
 different things: nomoi were ‘laws’ enacted through a special process
 of <span class="term">legislation</span>, while psephismata were
 ‘decrees’ passed by a vote of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The orator Aeschines in one of his
 speeches asks, rhetorically, why the laws (<span class="term">nomoi</span>) are good, but the decrees
 of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="term">psephismata</span>) are bad (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.177</span>). The philosopher Aristotle makes a theoretical distinction between laws and
 decrees, noting that in certain kinds of democracy the laws rule, but in other kinds of
 democracies decrees can override laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1292a</span>). Athens
 was the former kind of democracy, according to Demosthenes, who quotes a principle of Athenian governance, that <span class="quote_inline">No
 decree, either of the <span class="term">Council</span> or the <span class="term">Assembly</span> shall have more authority than a law</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.87</span>).</div>
 <div class="p">On the other hand, the laws could determine what sorts of decrees the <span class="term">Assembly</span> could pass, such as a law that allows the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to pass a decree honoring a citizen, but that limits
 the circumstances of such an honor (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin.
 3.36</span>). The <span class="term">courts</span> could nullify a decree, based
 on the laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.96</span>). When
 inscribed on stone for the permanent record, decrees begin with the formula, <span class="quote_inline">It was
 decided by the People,</span> or, <span class="quote_inline">It was decided by the <span class="term">Council</span> and the People</span> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span>
 II2 206 4-5</span>, <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span>
 II2 206 28-30</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span>
 II2 237.5</span>; <span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">IG</span>
 II2 237 31</span>); a law began with the formula, <span class="quote_inline">It was
 decided by the Lawgivers</span> (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">SEG</span> 12
 87.607</span>).</div>
 <div class="p">The Athenians had no ‘consitution’ such as the United States has, a
 body of laws that fundamentally define the state. Some laws, however, included additional
 clauses that made it very difficult to change or revoke the law. One such clause is quoted
 at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.62</span>: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Whosoever,
 whether magistrate or private citizen, shall cause this ordinance to be frustrated, or
 shall alter the same, shall be disfranchised with his children and his property</p></blockquote>
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.62</span>). </div>
 <div class="p">A law included as a quotation in a speech by the orator Andocides says, <blockquote class="quote"><p>In no circumstances shall magistrates enforce a law which
 has not been inscribed. No decree, whether of the <span class="term">Council</span>
 or <span class="term">Assembly</span>, shall override a law. No law shall be
 directed against an individual without applying to all citizens alike, unless an <span class="term">Assembly</span> of six thousand so resolve by secret ballot</p></blockquote>
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.87</span>). This establishes
 three important principles of Athenian <span class="term">legislation</span>: (in
 order from last to first) that except under very special circumstances, the laws of
 Athens were to apply to all citizens equally; that
 the laws (<span class="term">nomoi</span>) had more authority than the decrees
 (<span class="term">psephismata</span>) of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> or <span class="term">Council</span>; and finally that only the written laws were valid.</div>
 <p>According to Plutarch, when Solon revised the laws of Athens in the
 <span class="date">6th century BCE</span>, he wrote the new laws on wooden
 tablets (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Sol.</span>
 25.1</span>). By inscribing laws, either on wood or in stone, and setting them in a
 public place, knowledge of the laws was made available to all citizens, rather than to a
 small elite.</p>
 <p>The procedures for making new laws or revising existing laws was complicated, and seems
 to have been intended to make the process as democratic as possible, and to prevent any
 hasty or poorly considered changes to the laws.</p>
 <div class="p">Demosthenes describes process of <span class="term">legislation</span> in detail in his speech prosecuting Timocrates (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24</span>). He reminds the jurors that, <blockquote class="quote"><p>In our laws at present in force, men of
 Athens, every condition that must be observed when
 new statutes are to be enacted is laid down clearly and with precision. First of all,
 there is a prescribed time for <span class="term">legislation</span>; but even
 at the proper time a man is not permitted to propose his law just as he pleases. He is
 directed, in the first place, to put it in writing and post it in front of the statues
 of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span> for everyone to see.
 Then it is ordained that the law must be of universal application, and also that laws of
 contrary purpose must be repealed; and there are other directions with which I do not
 think I need trouble you now</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24.17</span>-18).</div>
 <p>While any citizen could suggest changes to the laws, laws were not passed by the <span class="term">Assembly</span> or the <span class="term">Council</span>, as
 decrees were, but were passed by a rather prolonged process involving the
 ‘Lawgivers,’ the nomothetae (the singular form is
 <span class="term">nomothete</span>). Panels of Nomothetae were formed for the purposes of creating
 new laws and reviewing existing laws; the Nomothetae were drawn from Athenians who had
 sworn the ‘dikastic oath,’ the oath that jurors swore before entering a
 courtroom (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>; a passage in
 Demosthenes, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.149-151</span>, purports to be the
 text of that oath). So these Nomothetae were ordinary citizens assigned the task of
 creating and revising the laws.</p>
 <p>These Nomothetae would get together and conduct <span class="term">legislation</span> under three circumstances: if the <span class="term">Assembly</span> called for revisions to the laws, if an individual Athenian proposed a
 change in the laws, and if the six <span class="term">Archons</span> called the
 Thesmothetae (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 55.1</span>) undertook a scrutiny of the laws (respectively: <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.38</span>). </p>
 <p>At the first meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> for the year, in the
 month of Hekatombaion, the Athenians held votes on the whole body of laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>; see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span> where the month of Hekatombaion
 is specified). This is how Demosthenes describes the
 process:</p>
 <div class="p"><blockquote class="quote"><p>In the first presidency and on the eleventh day thereof, in the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, the Herald having read prayers, a vote shall be
 taken on the laws, to wit, first upon laws respecting the <span class="term">Council</span>, and secondly upon general statutes, and then upon statutes enacted
 for the nine <span class="term">Archons</span>, and then upon laws affecting other
 authorities. Those who are content with the laws respecting the <span class="term">Council</span> shall hold up their hands first, and then those who are not content;
 and in like manner in respect of general statutes. All voting upon laws shall be in
 accordance with laws already in force</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>).</div>
 <div class="p">This passage tells us several things. First, it suggests that the laws of Athens were divided into several categories. There were laws
 concerning the <span class="term">Council</span>; this presumably included laws
 governing the Nomothetae and the procedure for <span class="term">legislation</span> itself, since it was the <span class="term">Council</span> that
 appointed the panels of Nomothetae (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24.27</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.47</span>-48). There
 were laws ‘common’ to all Athenians. There were laws having to do with
 the nine <span class="term">Archons</span>. And there were laws having to do with
 <span class="quote_inline">other authorities.</span> This passage also tells us that the <span class="term">Assembly</span> voted on the existing laws by a show of hands (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.20</span>).</div>
 <div class="p">Demosthenes continues his description of the annual
 review: <blockquote class="quote"><p>If any law already in force be rejected on show of hands, the presidents
 [the ‘Prytaneis’ described above in the discussion of the <span class="term">Council</span>] in whose term of office the voting takes place shall
 appoint the last of the three meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>
 for the consideration of laws so rejected. The commissioners [the
 ‘Proedroi’] who preside by lot at the <span class="term">Assembly</span> are required, immediately after religious observances, to put the
 question respecting the sessions of the Nomothetae, and respecting the fund from which
 their fees are to be paid. The Nomothetae shall consist of persons who have taken the
 judicial oath</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24.21</span>).</div>
 <div class="p">Before this meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, when the Athenians
 voted on the existing laws, anyone who wanted to change the laws was supposed to make
 public specific proposals for new laws: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Before the meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> any Athenian citizen who wishes shall write down
 the laws proposed by him and exhibit the same in front of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span>, to the end that the People may
 vote on the question of the time allowed to the Nomothetae with due regard to the total
 number of laws proposed. Whosoever proposes a new statute shall write it on a white
 board and exhibit it in front of the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span> on every day until the meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span>).</div>
 <p>This must have meant that the vote on the existing laws was equivalent to a vote on the
 proposed changes. If the citizens liked the suggestions posted beforehand, they could vote
 against the existing laws, thus starting a process of <span class="term">legislation</span>. If the citizens did not like the posted suggestions, they would
 vote in favor of the existing laws. Requiring proposed changes before the meeting would
 allow the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to make an informed decision regarding
 how long the Nomothetae should take to conduct their business (see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.94</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.36</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.39</span>).</p>
 <p>Demosthenes says, elsewhere in his speech against Timocrates, that it was lawful for any citizen to propose changing
 an existing law, but only if he suggested a new law to take its place (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">The <span class="term">Assembly</span>, at this first meeting of the year (on the
 11th day of the month Hekatombaion), would also choose five citizens to <span class="quote_inline">speak in
 defence of laws proposed for repeal before the Nomothetae</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span>). This suggests that the
 process of <span class="term">legislation</span> was very much like a trial in a
 courtroom, with some people ‘prosecuting’ the existing laws (and
 advocating new laws), and others defending the existing laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.36</span>).</div>
 <p>After this first meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> for the year, if
 the voting determined that the laws should be reviewed and possibly changed, there was a
 delay, presumably to let people consider matters. No further action happened at the next
 meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> in that month, but at the third
 meeting, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> decided how long the Nomothetae
 should spend legislating, and details of their pay (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 21.24</span>).</p>
 <p>The Nomothetae were not chosen until the actual day assigned for <span class="term">legislation</span>; on the morning of that day they were chosen by
 lot from those who had sworn the ‘Heliastic oath’ that all jurors swore
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>). A board of nomothetae
 could be huge: Demosthenes reports that in <span class="date">354/3</span> BCE, Timocrates passed
 in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> a decree setting up a board of 1001
 Nomothetae, and ordering the <span class="term">Council</span> to assist them in
 their work (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>).</p>
 <p>The meeting of the Nomothetae was conducted by ‘Proedroi’ (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>). The meeting was conducted
 like a trial, with advocates speaking in favor of the existing laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.23</span>), and others speaking in favor
 of changing the laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.36</span>).
 When both parties had spoken, the Nomothetae voted by show of hands (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>).</p>
 <p>Any new laws proposed by the Nomothetae were published near the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span> and were also read aloud to the next
 meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.94</span>). </p>
 <p>In addition to this regularly scheduled, annual, opportunity for <span class="term">legislation</span>, there were other ways of initiation the
 process of making changes to the laws of Athens. Any
 citizen could, at any time, propose a change in the laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>). The <span class="term">Archons</span>, specifically the Thesmothetae, were also charged with making an annual
 review of the existing laws and, if they found contradictory laws or redundant laws, they
 could arrange for a board of Nomothetae to change the laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.38</span>).</p>
 <p>In the case of an individual citizen who wanted to change the laws, he could not propose
 repealing a law without suggesting a new law to take its place (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.89</span>-94; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>). The <span class="term">Assembly</span> would decide whether or not the proposal had sufficient merit to be
 brought before the Nomothetae (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24.21</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 3.10</span>-13; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.39</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">The <span class="term">Council</span> had to be involved, too, because it was the
 <span class="term">Council</span> that set the agenda for meetings of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. So once a citizen had posted a proposal for new
 <span class="term">legislation</span>, the <span class="term">Council</span> had to put the issue on the agenda for a meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>; this was done by means of a Preliminary Decree, or
 <span class="term">probouleuma</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24.27</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.48</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.39</span>). <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span> contains a decree that orders
 <span class="quote_inline">the <span class="term">Council</span> to cooperate in the legislative
 process</span> in the matter of convening the Nomothetae, which may mean only that the
 <span class="term">Council</span> was to ensure that the business appeared on the
 agenda for the <span class="term">Assembly</span>. The <span class="term">Council</span> did, however, also have a special ‘legislative
 secretary,’ who made copies of all laws, and attended all meetings of the
 <span class="term">Council</span>; this suggests that the <span class="term">Council</span> discussed proposals for <span class="term">legislation</span>
 before sending them on to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 54.4</span>).</div>
 <p>Since laws, passed by the Nomothetae, were more important than decrees of the <span class="term">Council</span> or <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 1.87</span>), what happened when a decree
 contradicted a law? Or, what happened when someone proposed a law in a way that violated
 the laws governing <span class="term">legislation</span>?</p>
 <p>A ‘graphe paranomon,’ or ‘prosecution for having proposed an
 unlawful decree’ was the means by which the Athenians ensured the sovreignty
 of the laws; any such charge would be tried before the People’s <span class="term">Court</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 59.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>).</p>
 <p>Demosthenes’ speech against Timocrates focuses on just such a charge; the prosecution claims
 that Timocrates introduced a new law that contradicted an old
 law (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.33</span>). That doing so was
 illegal runs contrary to the assumption in American law that newer <span class="term">legislation</span> takes precedence over older laws.</p>
 <p>Demosthenes actually claims that Timocrates’ proposal was illegal for several reasons. First, it
 contradicted already existing laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24.33</span>). Second, the proposal had not been published by the statues of the <span class="term">Eponymous Heroes</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.18</span>). Third, he did not allow the
 <span class="term">Council</span> to consider the law before referring it to the
 <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.26</span>). Finally, he did not follow the lawful schedule, which would have
 meant proposing a new law at one meeting of the <span class="term">Assembly</span>,
 taking no action at the next meeting, and at the third meeting voting on whether or not to
 convene the Nomothetae (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.21</span>);
 Timocrates, it is alleged, proposed his law at one meeting of
 the <span class="term">Assembly</span> and moved that it be handed over to the
 Nomothetae on the very next day (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24.28</span>).</p>
 <p>Demosthenes’ speech against Leptines (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20</span>)
 is another example of a <span class="term">graphe paranomon</span>. Here, Demosthenes claims that Leptines arranged for the
 Nomothetae to pass a law without repealing any contrary laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.89</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.96</span>), publishing the proposal
 beforehand, or allowing the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to consider the
 matter before sending it to the Nomothetae (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.93</span>).</p>
 <p>Demosthenes himself was once charged with improperly
 suggesting the emendation of a law governing the maintenance of warships (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 18.105</span>). </p>
 <p>Aristotle criticizes direct democracy on the grounds
 that in democracy decrees have more authority than laws (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span>
 1297a4-7</span>). But this criticism does not seem to apply to the democracy of <span class="date">4th century</span>
 Athens.</p>
 <div class="p">We find a more apt criticism in Aristotle’s
 <span class="titlem">Constitution of the Athenians</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span></span>), which says that in Athens everything is decided by <span class="quote_inline">decrees and <span class="term">lawcourts</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 41.2</span>); since the legislators, the Nomothetae, were
 chosen from the same pool as potential jurors, and swore the same oaths as jurors (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.27</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 24.149</span>-151), this comment seems
 fairly accurate. Whether or not we should see this fact as a bad thing is, of course, a
 matter of opinion.</div>

 <div class="Section" id="areopagus"><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">Athenian Democracy: the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span></span></h2>
 
 <p>The Areopagus, or Hill of Ares, in Athens
 was the site of council that served as an important legal institution under the Athenian
 democracy. This body, called the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, or simply the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, existed long
 before the democracy, and its powers and composition changed many times over the
 centuries. Originally, it was the central governing body of Athens, but under the democracy, it was primarily the court with
 jurisdiction over cases of homicide and certain other serious crimes. After an Athenian
 had served as one of the nine <span class="term">archons</span>, his conduct in
 office was investigated, and if he passed that investigation he became a member of the
 <span class="term">Areopagus</span>; tenure was for life.</p>
 <p>The Areopagus (<span class="term">Areios pagos</span>)
 was a hill in Athens, south of the agora, to the north-west of the Acropolis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 8.52</span>). The term <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, however, often
 refers to the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, a governmental
 institution that met on that hill (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin.
 1.92</span>). This institution was very ancient, existing long before democratic
 government. Its history, which recedes back into mythological pre-history, follows closely
 the political history of Athens, and shows the ongoing
 tension between democratic and anti-democratic forces (see, for example, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 15.316</span>, in which he complains that
 as the city grew more democratic, the power of the older institutions, such as the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, declined). </p>
 <p>The Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> functioned as a court under
 the democracy of <span class="date">4th century</span>
 Athens, and it had a very high reputation (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.65</span>). The orator Lycurgus tells his fellow Athenians that they have in the
 Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> the finest model in Greece: a court so superior to others that even the men
 convicted in it admit that its judgements are just (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lyc. 1.12</span>). </p>
 <p>The Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, as a group, and its
 individual members were held in high regard and considered to be worthy of respect. Aeschines reports an incident when Autolycus, a member of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>,
 unwittingly made a sexual pun; when the people laughed, Pyrrandrus scolded them, asking if they were not ashamed of themselves for
 laughing in the presence of the Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.84</span>). Aeschines is careful to defend Autolycus, as a man whose life has been good and pious, and so worthy of that
 body, i.e. the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.82</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">The principle function of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, in the <span class="date">4th century</span> BCE, was to try cases of homicide. Demosthenes describes this function and the lengths to which
 the court ensured that its proceedings were fair and just; this passage, addressed to the
 Athenians, also suggests that the Athenians saw a strong relationship between human and
 divine justice: <blockquote class="quote"><p>You are all of course aware that in the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, where the law both permits and enjoins the trial of homicide,
 first, every man who brings accusation of such a crime must make oath by invoking
 destruction upon himself, his kindred, and his household; secondly, that he must not
 treat this oath as an ordinary oath, but as one which no man swears for any other
 purpose; for he stands over the entrails of a boar, a ram, and a bull, and they must
 have been slaughtered by the necessary officers and on the days appointed, so that in
 respect both of the time and of the functionaries every requirement of solemnity has
 been satisfied. Even then the person who has sworn this tremendous oath does not gain
 immediate credence; and if any falsehood is brought home to him, he will carry away with
 him to his children and his kindred the stain of perjury—but gain nothing. If,
 on the other hand, he is believed to be laying a just charge, and if he proves the
 accused guilty of murder, even then he has no power over the convicted criminal; only
 the laws and the appointed officers have power over the man for punishment.</p></blockquote>
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.67</span>-69). </div>
 <p>The <span class="term">Areopagus</span> consisted of former <span class="term">archons</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
 <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24.22</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 60.3</span>). This meant that all members of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> had been thoroughly investigated by officials of
 the democracy. All incoming <span class="term">archons</span> were subject to
 scrutiny (<span class="term">dokimasia</span>) by the sitting <span class="term">archons</span>—an investigation into their qualifications to
 serve—before they assumed their office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.9</span>). At the end of their year of
 service, each <span class="term">archon</span> was investigated by the
 People’s <span class="term">Court</span>, the <span class="term">Heliaia</span>; only those <span class="term">archons</span> who passed this
 public audit (<span class="term">euthuna</span>) could become members of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 26.5</span>). An
 archon could fail this audit (<span class="term">euthuna</span>) by violating any of the laws governing
 the conduct of his office (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24.22</span>). For example, the <span class="term">Eponymous Archon</span> was
 responsible for collecting and holding the olive oil that was given as a prize at the
 Panathenaic Games; this archon was not allowed to become a member of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> until he had handed all of the oil over to the
 treasurers on the Acropolis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 60.3</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">Appointment to the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> was for life (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3.6</span>;
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.11</span>). Nevertheless, members
 of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, the Areopagites, were still subject to
 audit (<span class="term">euthuna</span>). Aeschines describes this
 to his fellow Athenians as a democratic measure: <blockquote class="quote"><p>For, first, the Council of the
 <span class="term">Areopagus</span> is required by the law to file its accounts
 with the Board of Auditors and to submit to their examination; yes, even those men, who
 sit with solemn aspect yonder as the court of highest competence, are brought under your
 verdict</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.20</span>).</div>
 <p>Members of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> seem to have received a free
 portion of the meat from certain sacrifices, an added benefit of service (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.56</span>) </p>
 <p>The Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> met generally on the Areopagus, the Hill of Ares (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.65</span>-66; Isoc. 7.38). Demosthenes
 mentions the body meeting in the Stoa
 Basileus in the agora, which was roped
 off for the occasion, so the court would not be disturbed (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 25.23</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">The <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, functioning as a court of law during the
 <span class="date">4th century</span>, had a reputation for following
 unimpeachable procedures. In his speech against Aristocrates,
 Demosthenes describes this procedure at some length,
 and begins his description with the claim that no convicted defendant and no defeated
 prosecutor has ever made good any complaint against the justice of the verdict given.
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.66</span>). <span class="quote_inline">Anyone who
 brought an accusation of homicide before the court had to swear an oath invoking
 destruction upon himself, his kindred, and his household</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.67</span>). The swearing of this oath was
 unique: a boar, a ram, and a bull were to be sacrificed by certain people and on certain
 days (Demosthenes does not say which people or which
 days), so that in respect both of the time and of the functionaries every requirement of
 solemnity has been satisfied; the accuser then stood over the entrails of the sacrificed
 animals and swore his oath. Demosthenes is careful to
 add that, even with this tremendous oath, the accuser was not automatically believed, and
 that if he should be proved to have lied, not only would he bear the stain of perjury
 himself, but his children and relatives would as well (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.68</span>).</div>
 <div class="p">In this speech and elsewhere, Demosthenes emphasizes
 the extent to which the rights of the accused were protected by law and procedure.
 <blockquote class="quote"><p>If the accuser won his case, and the accused was convicted, the accuser had no
 power of punishment: only the laws and the appointed officer have power over the man for
 punishment. The prosecutor is permitted to see him suffering the penalty awarded by law,
 and that is all</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 23.69</span>). If the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> found a defendant guilty
 in a case of homicide, the court seems to have had the authority to hand him straight over
 to the executioner (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.62</span>;
 although this passage refers to powers given to the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> by a particular decree in the late <span class="date">4th
 century</span>). In other matters, though the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>’ power of punishment was not unlimited. Speaking of a case of
 impiety, Demosthenes says that the court does not have
 the power to punish any of the Athenians as they see fit. (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.80</span>).</div>
 <div class="p">Defendants swore the same oath as accusers, but Demosthenes says that they had an important additional right: <blockquote class="quote"><p>it is
 permitted to them to depart after giving his first speech, and neither the prosecutor,
 nor the jurors, nor any other man is authorized to prevent it</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.69</span>). We may suppose (although
 Demosthenes does not make this clear) that the
 defendant would have had to leave Athens after
 withdrawing from the trial.</div>
 <div class="p">The trial would proceed with each side giving one or more speeches (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Din. 1.1</span>, where he says that he does not
 have to give all the details of the case because a fellow-prosecutor, Stratocles, has already given his speech). Aeschines, speaking in praise of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>,
 says that this court was different from the other courts of Athens in that Areopagites were less likely than other jurors to be swayed
 by skillful speaking alone: <blockquote class="quote"><p>I myself have before now seen many men convicted before
 this tribunal, though they spoke most eloquently, and presented witnesses; and I know
 that before now certain men have won their case, although they spoke most feebly, and
 although no witnesses testified for them. For it is not on the strength of the pleading
 alone, nor of the testimony alone, that the members of the court give their verdict, but
 on the strength of their own knowledge and their own investigations. And this is the
 reason why that tribunal maintains its high repute in the city</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.92</span>).</div>
 <p>The <span class="term">Archon Basileus</span>, or <span class="term">King
 Archon</span> served as the introducing official, but it seems that he did not actually
 participate in deciding the case; only the actual members of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> voted (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.4</span>). Because members of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> had all served as <span class="term">archons</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
 <span class="titlem">Sol.</span> 19.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 24.22</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 60.3</span>), and because, as <span class="term">archons</span>,
 they would each have had experience presiding over the various courts of Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 56.6-7</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 57.2-4</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 58.2</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 59.2-6</span>), and because they served on the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> for life (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 3.6</span>;
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 26.11</span>), they must have had much
 more experience than the juries of the other courts.</p>
 <p>According to Aristotle, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> did not allow speakers, either defendants or prosecutors, to introduce
 irrelevant information into their speeches; in this, he says, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> is different from the other <span class="term">courts</span> at Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Rh.</span> 1354a
 20</span>).</p>
 <p>If a speaker was accused of perjury (<span class="term">pseudomarturia</span>) before the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, he would not be prosecuted by the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> itself, but by the <span class="term">Archons</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 59.6</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">In the <span class="date">4th century</span> BCE, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> was responsible for trying cases of the most
 serious crimes. Aristotle says: <span class="quote_inline">Trials for
 deliberate murder and wounding are held in the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, and for causing death by poison, and for arson</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.3</span>;
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.22</span>). Other kinds of
 murder—involuntary homicide, conspiracy to murder, murder of a slave, resident
 alien, or foreign—were tried at the Palladium (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.3</span>).
 Still other kinds of murder—when the accused claimed that the killing was legal,
 as a matter of self-defense or in a case of adultery, or if someone accidentally killed a
 fellow citizen in war or during an athletic competition—were tried at the
 Delphinium (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 57.3</span>). In the case of adultery, the orator Lysias says that
 <blockquote class="quote"><p>the Court of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> itself, to which has
 been assigned, in our own as in our fathers’ time, the trial of suits for
 murder, has expressly stated that whoever takes this vengeance on an adulterer caught in
 the act with his spouse shall not be convicted of murder</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 1.30</span>).</div>
 <p>The <span class="term">Areopagus</span> also heard cases of assault and wounding
 (<span class="term">trauma</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 40.32</span>;
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.22</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.93</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 57.3</span>).
 The <span class="term">Areopagus</span> did not merely punish the assailants
 themselves, but also had the power to punish accessories. Demosthenes mentions a case of assault where the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> exiled a man for encouraging the assailant; the defendant in this case
 was the father of the priestess of Artemis at Brauron, and therefore an important Athenian, but punished as
 an accessory nevertheless (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 54.25</span>).</p>
 <p>According to Demosthenes, not only did the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> permit Athenians to bring cases of homicide before
 it for judgement, but actually required it (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.67</span>). Demosthenes himself was fined by
 the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, according to Aeschines, for failing to pursue a charge of assault against his cousin Demomeles (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin.
 2.93</span>).</p>
 <p>The members of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, the Areopagites, also seem
 to have investigated murders and assaults personally. In a speech prosecuting Conon, Demosthenes says that it
 was possible for members of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> to come to the
 bedside of a victim of assault, because if the victim should eventually die, they would
 have to try the case of his murder (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 54.28</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">It was a very serious matter to be charged with a crime before the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>. In a speech written by Demosthenes for a client the speaker describes how his enemies plotted against
 him: <blockquote class="quote"><p>When they have thus openly laid a plot, and got up a charge against me before
 the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, do you suppose there is any poisoning or
 any other such villainy from which they would abstain?</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 40.57</span>). This passage compares being
 charged before the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> with being poisoned, and
 gives us an idea of how serious such a charge was. Elsewhere in that same speech, the
 speaker explains that his enemies hoped that by charging him before the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, he would go into exile rather than risk conviction
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 40.32</span>).</div>
 <p>According to the rules of procedure, a defendant charged before the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> had the option of leaving the city rather than see
 the trial to its conclusion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 23.69</span>). If the defendant left, then his property was
 sold off by the Venders (<span class="term">poletai</span>), after the Nine <span class="term">Archons</span> gave their approval for the sale (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 47.2</span>).</p>
 <p>Among the serious crimes that fell to the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> were
 certain kinds of sacrilege. One example we know of had to do with a woman who had served
 as a priestess for the festival of Anthesteria, in honor of the god Dionysus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.78</span>). In
 this case, the woman was married to an Athenian named Theogenes, and it became known that she was not herself properly an Athenian
 citizen (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.81</span>). The matter was
 investigated by the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.80</span>). According to Demosthenes, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>
 was initially inclined to impose the highest fine in its power on Theogenes for allowing his wife to serve as priestess under false pretenses
 (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.81</span>), but they relented
 because Theogenes convinced them that he had been deceived, and
 meant no harm (Theogenes immediately expelled his wife from his
 house) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.83</span>).</p>
 <p>The <span class="term">Areopagus</span> had authority over the sacred olive trees
 of Attica as well. If anyone was accused of cutting
 down a sacred olive tree, he was tried before the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 7.22</span>). Aristotle explains that the city of Athens collected the fruit from the olive trees and pressed it into oil,
 which would then be stored on the Acropolis or sold; if anyone dug up or cut down one of
 the trees, he would be tried by the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, and if he
 were found guilty, the penalty used to be death (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 60.1-2</span>). But, Aristotle continues, in his own
 time (the middle of the <span class="date">4th century</span>), while the law
 still exists, such a trial has fallen out of use (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 60.2</span>).
 Even in the early <span class="date">4th century</span>, it seems that the
 penalty was not death, but exile and confiscation of property (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 7.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 7.32</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys. 7.41</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">In the latter part of the <span class="date">4th century</span>, the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> exercised other powers beyond its traditional role
 as a court. The <span class="term">Areopagus</span> could be called on, by the
 <span class="term">Council</span> or the <span class="term">Assembly</span>,
 to investigate certain public matters and issue a report to the <span class="term">People</span>. In one case that we hear of, Timarchus passed
 a motion in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to have the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> investigate and report on some dwellings that had
 been erected on the hill of the Pnyx (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 1.81</span>). A member of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, Autolycus, gave the
 body’s report to the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and in doing so
 reminded the assembled people that, <span class="quote_inline">We Areopagites do not, men of Athens, either accuse or defend, for that is not our
 tradition</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin.
 1.83</span>).</div>
 </div>
 <div class="Section" id="court"><h2><span class="headingNumber">9. </span><span class="head">Athenian Democracy: the People’s <span class="term">Court</span></span></h2>
 
 <p>Of almost equal importance to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> and <span class="term">Council</span>, and probably of greater importance (if not greater
 prestige) than the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> was the People’s
 <span class="term">Court</span>, the <span class="term">Heliaea</span> and
 other <span class="term">courts</span> where juries of citizens would listen to
 cases, would vote on the guilt or innocence of their fellow citizens, and vote on
 punishments for those found guilty.</p>
 <p>Since Athenian law is the subject of this discussion series, the present introduction to
 Athenian democracy will not describe the <span class="term">lawcourts</span> in as
 much detail as it has given to the <span class="term">Assembly</span> and <span class="term">Council</span>.</p>
 <p>Athenians who served on juries received one-half drachma a day, or three obols, for their
 service (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 62.2</span>). Payment for service was a democratic innovation, of course, because it
 allowed the poorer citizens to participate in the governance of their city. There was no
 property requirement for service; any citizen who did not owe any debts to the treasury,
 was at least thirty years old, and had not lost his <span class="term">citizenship</span> through any legal action could serve as a juror (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 63.3</span>).</p>
 <p>Aristotle’s description of the Athenian <span class="term">lawcourts</span> and the juries that served on them focuses on the
 elaborate systems that seem to have existed to thwart attempts to bribe juries (this
 description starts at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
 Pol.</span> 63.1</span>). These anti-bribery measures seem to have focused on making
 every aspect of <span class="term">jury</span> selection and allocation among the
 various <span class="term">courts</span> as unpredictable as possible. Jurors would
 be selected, randomly, from the pool of people willing to serve. The would be divided into
 groups, one group for every active courtroom, randomly and at the last minute. The
 individual groups would be assigned to individual courtrooms randomly and at the last
 minute. And there were elaborate checks to ensure that only authorized jurors entered each
 courtroom.</p>
 <p>Since the <span class="term">lawcourts</span> were charged with hearing, not only
 cases of criminal and civil matters, but appeals on the part of citizens who were
 unsatisfied with rulings by the <span class="term">Council</span> or <span class="term">Assembly</span>, this elaborate effort to ensure that the juries were
 truly honest embodiments of the Demos makes sense. The <span class="term">courts</span> were the ultimate guarantor of democratic rule, and so the juries that
 ruled those <span class="term">courts</span> had to be as democratic as
 possible.</p>
 <p>Timekeeping was also important during the course of trials, to ensure that the plaintiff
 and the defendant had equal time to speak. Aristotle
 describes the water-clock (<span class="term">klepsydra</span>) that measured the time for each
 side’s speeches. One of the jurors, appointed by lot, poured water into a large
 jar from which the water ran out in a steady stream; when the jar was empty, the speaker’s
 time was up. The amount of water poured into the clock varied according to the magnitude
 of issue at stake. For suits involving sums of money up to 2000 drachmas, each side got to
 speak for seven measures of water, for suites between 2000 and 5000 drachmas, nine
 measures of water, and for suits of over 5000 drachmas, ten measures. For cases in which
 the defendant stood to lose all of his property, his <span class="term">citizenship</span>, or his life, the whole day—eleven measures of
 water—was given over to the trial. (See <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 67</span>).</p>
 <p>Juries varied in size from 501 jurors in lesser cases, up to 1500 for the most important
 matters (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
 68.1</span>). Decisions did not have to be unanimous; after both sides in the case had
 given one or two speeches, the jurors voted by dropping ballots into two jars. Each juror
 had two ballots, one representing the plaintiff and the other representing the defendant.
 One after another, the jurors inserted their ballots into two urns. The bronze urn was for
 the vote that counted; the wooden urn was for discarding the unused ballot. As each juror
 voted, he was given a token which he could redeem for his juror’s fee of 3 obols
 (one-half a drachma). (See <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
 <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 68</span>). After the voting, the courtroom attendants
 emptied the bronze urn in full view of both parties to the suit and counted the ballots.
 Whichever side received the most votes won (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 69</span>).</p>
 <div class="p">While the <span class="term">Archons</span> were responsible for ensuring the proper
 running of the Athenian <span class="term">courts</span>, they did not serve as
 judges. In fact, there was no one in an Athenian courtroom who was a recognized legal
 authority, except for the several hundred (at least) jurors chosen from the Demos
 generally. Plaintiffs and defendants, at least those with the laws of Athens on their side, had to rely on the citizens’
 knowledge of the laws. In a speech before an Athenian <span class="term">jury</span>, the orator Demosthenes reminded them that,
 <span class="quote_inline">You have sworn to give a verdict according to the laws, and to the decrees of the
 People and of the <span class="term">Council</span> of Five Hundred</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 19.179</span>; note that he mentions the
 laws before the decrees).</div>
 <div class="p">But with no presiding judge, plaintiffs and defendant also had to rely on the
 jurors’ just-mindedness (or susceptibility to rhetoric), especially when the law
 was obscure or non-existant. During a different trial from the one just mentioned, Demosthenes reminded another Athenian <span class="term">jury</span> that, <blockquote class="quote"><p>Again, men of Athens, you must also consider well and carefully the fact that you have
 come into <span class="term">court</span> today, sworn to give your verdict
 according to the laws… and where there are no statutes to guide you, you are
 sworn to decide according to the best of your judgement</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 20.118</span>). So in the absence of clear
 laws, jurors were free to vote according to unwritten laws, or their own understanding of
 justice (or their own prejudices).</div>

 <div class="Section" id="the_end"><h2><span class="headingNumber">10. </span><span class="head">The End of Athenian Democracy</span></h2>
 
 <p>What happened to Athenian democracy? As with the rise of democratic governance in
 Athens (described briefly in <span class="term">another article</span>), its decline was a gradual
 process, marked by a few dramatic moments and several reversals of fortune.</p>
 <p>The decline had much to do with the rise of Macedonia as a power in the Greek world, under the leadership first of
 Philip and then of his son, Alexander. In <span class="date">338</span> BCE, Philip’s army defeated the allied forces of Athens and Thebes in a battle at
 Chaeronea. This defeat forced Athens to enter into the so-called League of Corinth, ostensibly a pan-Hellenic alliance aimed at opposing
 the power of Persia, but actually an organization that
 gave Philip unprecedented authority over Greek affairs.</p>
 <p>Upon Philip’s death, Alexander took over leadership of this League, and used it to help launch his
 invasion of Asia and his war with the Persian Empire.
 After Alexander’s departure from Greece in <span class="date">335</span> BCE, the Athenians
 spent the next eleven years in an unsettled state. On the one hand, they were more-or-less
 entirely free from foreign interference in their domestic affairs; on the other hand,
 there was a powerful body of Macedonian soldiers under the command of Antipater waiting in northern Greece to put down any
 effort at resisting Macedonian will. During Alexander’s life, the Macedonians did not actually use force against the
 Athenians at any point, but this was only because the Athenians did not openly act against
 Macedonian wishes. The Spartans, under king Agis III, did try to assert their independence and were thoroughly,
 though not easily, defeated in a battle at Megalopolis in <span class="date">331</span> or <span class="date">330</span> BCE.</p>
 <p>Things changed in <span class="date">324</span> BCE, when Alexander reappeared in western Asia after his
 march to India. In that year he issued the so-called
 ‘Exiles Decree’ that commanded every Greek city to readmit any former
 citizens who had been disenfranchised. Alexander also
 announced, from Asia, that he intended to end Athenian
 rule over Samos and to return control of the island to
 the Samians. This was a heavy-handed and, to many Athenians, unacceptable interference in
 the sovereignty of Athens. Under the leadership of an
 Athenian named Leosthenes, Athens began collecting a mercenary army and forming plans (if vague ones)
 to do something toward regaining true freedom as an independent polis.</p>
 <p>Things changed even more dramatically in <span class="date">323</span> BCE, when news of
 Alexander’s death reached the Greeks of Europe. The Athenians turned on any of their fellow citizens
 who had spoken in favor of cooperating with Macedonia—the orator Demades,
 who had passed a motion in the <span class="term">Assembly</span> to award divine
 honors to Alexander, was fined ten talents, and Aristotle, who had been tutor to the young Alexander himself, wisely moved out of Athens.</p>
 <p>And as <span class="date">323</span> came to a close, Leosthenes, leading Athenian and allied forces, attacked the Macedonian forces
 under Antipater in the north. The effort was initially
 successful, but Leosthenes was killed while besieging the
 fortress of Lamia, Macedonian reinforcements arrived
 during the spring of <span class="date">322</span>, and the by summer of that year the
 Athenians had lost both on land and sea.</p>
 <p>The Macedonian Antipater imposed a settlement on Athens, which was in no position to resist, that brought about
 an end of the city’s autonomy in foreign affairs and democratic self-rule at
 home. The revisions to the Athenian constitution limited <span class="term">citizenship</span> to those whose wealth amounted to at least 2000 drachmas; there was
 also to be a garrison of Macedonian forces stationed in the harbor of Piraeus.</p>
 <p>Thereafter, while many of the institutions of the Athenian democracy continued to
 function, and the constitution underwent further changes, sometimes toward more
 inclusiveness and freedom, and sometimes toward less, Athens would never again be completely free in domestic and foreign policy,
 and would never again be ruled by the will of the Demos, meeting in its <span class="term">Assembly</span>.</p>
 <p>(The story of the end of Athenian democracy, which is unfortunately missing from many
 general descriptions of Greek history, is well told in <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">D.L.
 Schneider, trans., Christan Habicht, <span class="titlem">Athens
 from Alexander to Antony</span>
