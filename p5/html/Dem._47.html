 <p>Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Against Evergus and Mnesibulus</span>, see also Oratory. While this speech comes down to us among
 the body of Demosthenes’ orations, it was
 probably written by Apollodorus on behalf of a plaintiff
 (whose name we do not know) in his suit against Evergus and
 Mnesibulus, whom the plaintiff charges with having given
 false testimony in a previous suit. This suit is the culmination of a long and somewhat
 complicated history of acrimony between the plaintiff and Theophemus. The tension began when the plaintiff assumed the duties of a
 trierarch (<span class="foreign">τριηραρξῶν</span>), a liturgy (<span class="foreign">λειτουργία</span>) (or service to the state) that was contracted out
 from time to time to wealthy citizens. The trierarch was responsible for outfitting a
 trireme (a warship) in the Athenian fleet, ensuring that the ship was ready for service
 when called upon. In performing his duties, the trierarch made use of equipment from the
 public stores, which had to be returned at the end of his period of service. Theophemus, who had served as trierarch prior to the plaintiff,
 ignored the request of the plaintiff for the return of the equipment. Upon his refusal,
 the plaintiff reported Theophemus’ refusal to the
 <span class="term">Council of the Five Hundred</span> (<span class="foreign">τῆς
 βουλῆς τῶν πεντακοσίων</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 47.18</span>), who gave him official permission to use whatever means available to
 recover the property. When the plaintiff tried to seize other property of Theophemus as security, a fist-fight erupted (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.38</span>). As a result of this, the
 plaintiff brought Theophemus before the <span class="term">Council</span> because of his non-compliance. The <span class="term">Council</span> was prepared to inflict the highest possible fine (500 drachmas, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.43</span>; see also <span class="term">Money</span>), but compromised at the last moment by assessing a fine of 25 drachmas
 and a promise of arbitration in the question of the fist fight. After a long stint at sea,
 the plaintiff returned and called arbitrators (<span class="foreign">διαιτητῶν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.45</span>)
 to settle the matter but Theophemus again refused to co-operate
 and brought a countersuit against the plaintiff in court. While the charges involved in
 Theophemus’ countersuit are not stated, we do know
 that he won a judgement against the plaintiff in the amount of 1100 drachmas and forcing
 the plaintiff to pay the fine for not receiving enough votes (<span class="foreign">ἐπωβολία</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.64</span>).
 However, because of his duties as trierarch, the plaintiff was not immediately able to pay
 the judgement of 1100 drachmas and asked for more time. Later, when the plaintiff did
 attempt to pay the money, he was ignored by Theophemus, who
 went that same day to the plaintiff’s farm and seized property (50 sheep and
 some household slaves) greatly in excess of the 1100 drachmas that he was owed (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.52-53</span>). The next day, Theophemus accepted the plaintiff’s money but would not
 return the confiscated property unless the plaintiff would drop all charges against him
 and his friends, Evergus and Mnesibulus. The plaintiff refused this offer but on the very next day, after
 payment had already been made, Evergus returned to the
 plaintiff’s farm and seized additional property (some furniture) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.56</span>). At this point, the plaintiff
 brought Evergus and Mnesibulus, two
 men who had served as witnesses on behalf of Theophemus, into
 court on charges of false testimony. This is the subject of the present trial. In his
 speech, the plaintiff charges that Evergus and Mnesibulus lied to the court about Theophemus’ role in the fist-fight. He also deplored the violence with
 which they had come to seize his property. In particular, the plaintiff mentions their
 rough treatment of his elderly nursemaid (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 47.81</span>). Because the speech mentions the archonship of Agathocles (<span class="date">356 BCE</span>) (source for date: <span class="bibl">A.T.
 Murray, <span class="titlem">Demosthenes II</span> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930]
 303</span>), this speech can be said to have taken place sometime after that date.</p>
