<div class="p">Herodotus of Halicarnassus was one of the earliest Greek writers of history in prose (see also History). His monumental work begins: <blockquote class="quote"><p>This is the presentation of the inquiries of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, in order that neither should the things done by men fade away through time, nor should great and wonderful achievements, some performed by Greeks, some by barbarians, become without renown, not only generally, but particularly for what cause they waged war on each other</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 1.1</span>). His word, which we translate ‘inquiry,’ is <span class="term">historia</span>, which gives us the English word ‘history.’</div>

<p>Herodotus lived and during the <span class="date">5th century BCE</span>, although his dates are unclear. He describes events that happened in the <span class="date">480s BCE</span> without ever claiming himself to have witness them or even have lived through them (and he <em>does</em> mention many things that he saw with his own eyes). On the other hand, the comic poet Aristophanes includes a parody of Herodotus’ history in a play that was produced in <span class="date">425</span> BCE (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3, <span class="term">s.v.</span> ‘Herodotus’</span>), starting at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Ach.</span> 515</span>. So, we can assume that Herodotus reached adulthood after the <span class="date">480s</span> BCE and had written his book well before <span class="date">425</span> BCE.</p>

<p>Herodotus’ history ultimately focuses on the wars between the Greeks and the Persian Empire, starting with the revolt (in <span class="date">499</span> BCE) of Greek cities of Ionia, which had come under Persian sway in the last quarter of the <span class="date">6th century</span>, through the Persian invasion of Attica in <span class="date">490</span> BCE, which ended with the battle of Marathon, to Xerxes’ invasion of Greece in <span class="date">480</span> and <span class="date">479</span> BCE. But Herodotus tries to put this conflict in a more universal context and to describe it in terms of some fundamental truths of human affairs. Accordingly, he traces the roots of the wars back into the <span class="date">6th century</span> and the reign of Croesus, king of Lydia. He also describes the geographies, cultures, and mythologies of all of the peoples in and around the Greek world.</p>

<p>Because of this last element in Herodotus’ work, he has from time to time throughout history been criticized for a lack of focus, a lack of truthfulness, or a failure to keep his ‘history’ rational and objective. But in many ways Herodotus’ work is more comprehensive and useful than that of his successor Thucydides. The latter reports only those ‘facts’ that he himself believes to be true. Herodotus, on the other hand, says that he is obliged to report whatever he has heard, even if he not not obliged to believe it all (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 7.152</span>). For Herodotus, it seems, not only are factual accounts valuable for uncovering the past, but false beliefs are also, because they too can influence how human beings interact with each other.</p>

<p>Herodotus was born in Halicarnassus, which is modern Bodrum in what is now Turkey. This city was a melting-pot of Greeks and non-Greeks, which almost certainly contributed to Herodotus’ open-minded interest in other cultures. He lived for a number of years in Athens, whose history and affairs he describes with admiration—see for example his discussion of Pericles at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 6.131</span>, or his praise of Athenian democracy at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 5.78</span>. Herodotus spent the last years of his life in the Greek colony of Thurii, in southern Italy (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Suda eta,536</span>).</p>

<p>Because Herodotus makes no effort to limit his reporting to objectively factual material, any reader should use caution when relying on him as a source for events. But because of his broad appreciation for how culture, legend, personality, and accident can shape history, his work offers insights into ancient history that can be found nowhere else.</p>
