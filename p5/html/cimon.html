    <p>Cimon, son of Miltiades (father) and
      Hegesipyle (mother), was a prominent Athenian in the <span class="date">first half of the 5th century BCE</span>. He was instrumental in
     leading Athens to a dominant position in the Greek world
     after the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, and he opposed the more radical
     democratic reforms of Ephialtes and Pericles, particularly their reform of the <span class="term">Court of the
      Areopagus</span>.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="Introduction"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Introduction: Cimon’s Family and Character</span></h2>
    
    <div class="p">In the <span class="date">early 5th century BCE</span>
     Athens became increasingly more democratic as the older
     institutions, which were dominated by the wealthy, lost power to newer institutions that were
     in the hands of the <span class="term">People</span>. This change was not welcomed by
     everyone, and even a hundred years later, an aristocratic Athenian like Isocrates could complain of how, after the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, <blockquote class="quote"><p>the city grew powerful and seized the
      empire of the Greeks, and our fathers, growing more self-assured than was proper for them,
      began to look with disfavor on those good men and true who had made Athens great, envying them their power, and growing to look instead to men who
      were low-born and full of insolence</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Isoc. 15.316</span>). When he outlines the history of the government of
      Athens, Aristotle notes
     that at this critical point in the history of the democracy, the leadership of the <span class="term">People</span> was held by Ephialtes, while the
     wealthy Athenians followed Cimon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      28.2</span>).</div>
    <p>Cimon’s deme, the district in Attica where he was
     registered as a citizen, was Laciadae (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      27.3</span>), and he was of the tribe (<span class="foreign">φυλή</span>) Oineis (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 17.3-6</span>).</p>
    <div class="p">Cimon’s father was Miltiades, a famous
     Athenian, and his mother was Hegesipyle, who was not an Athenian but
     the daughter of Olorus, king of Thrace (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 4.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 26.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 6.39.2</span>). The family was
     very wealthy. His father, Miltiades, had been <span class="term">general</span> on a failed military expedition to Paros in <span class="date">490</span> or <span class="date">489 BCE</span>
     (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Rhodes, 324-325</span>), and had been fined for that
     failure. When Miltiades died, his son Cimon paid the fine, which was 50 talents, a vast sum of money (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt. 6.136.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 4.4</span>).
      Aristotle says that Cimon
     <span class="quote_inline">had an estate large enough for a tyrant,</span> but adds this comment on his reputation
     for generosity: <blockquote class="quote"><p>anyone of the Laciadae who liked
      could come to his house every day and have a moderate supply, and also all his farms were
      unfenced, to enable anyone who liked to avail himself of the harvest.</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      27.2-3</span>; Plutarch tells the same story at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.1
     </span>-2). Demosthenes, writing in the <span class="date">4th century BCE</span>, suggests that Cimon had a
     reputation for modesty, citing him as an example of how, in the ‘old days’
     of the <span class="date">early 5th century</span>, the houses of wealthy and famous
     Athenians were no different from those of ordinary citizens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 13.29</span>). It is possible that
      Cimon had also been a victor in the games at Olympia (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 4.33</span>).</div>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="EarlyCareer"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Cimon’s Early Career</span></h2>
    
    <p>Cimon came to public prominence for the first time, it seems, in
      <span class="date">480 BCE</span>, when the army from Persia was marching toward Athens (source for
     date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
      <span class="titlem">OCD</span>
      3
     </span>). Faced with an invasion of Attica, the politician
      Themistocles urged the Athenians to abandon the territory of
      Attica to the enemy, take refuge on the island of
      Salamis and in the Peloponnese, and trust in Athens’ fleet of
     warships. Cimon made a flamboyant and effective gesture of support
     for this proposal: he marched up to the Acropolis and gave his horse’s bridle as a gift to the goddess Athene, thus indicating that he would not need his cavalry equipment, since he would
     trust in the navy. In the ensuing naval battle off the island of Salamis he performed bravely, and from those events became well known in
      Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 5.2-3</span>).</p>
    <div class="p">Many ancient writers, often unsympathetic or actively hostile toward the idea of democracy,
     describe the history of Athens in the <span class="date">5th</span> and <span class="date">4th centuries</span> as an ongoing
     struggle between the rich and the poor (who were often referred to as the <span class="term">People</span>)—or between ‘aristocracy’ (after
      <em>aristoi</em>, ‘the best people,’ a euphemism for the rich) and
      ‘democracy’ (after the <span class="term">demos</span>, the <span class="term">People</span>)—with prominent Athenians championing one side or the other. Aristotle, for example, summarizes Athenian history in terms of
     this struggle, saying that at the <span class="date">end of the 6th century</span>
     Cleisthenes took the side of the <span class="term">People</span>, while Isagoras represented the rich; later, Xanthippus took the side of the <span class="term">People</span>, and
      Miltiades took the side of the rich; and then, after the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, Themistocles and Ephialtes took the side of the <span class="term">People</span>,
     while Aristides and Cimon took the side
     of the rich (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath.
       Pol.</span> 28.2</span>). Plutarch tells the same story of
      ‘party politics’ (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 5.4</span>), and goes so far as to say that Cimon restored Athens to a <span class="quote_inline">the
      legendary community of Cronus</span> (<span class="foreign">τὴν ἐπὶ
      Κρόνου μυθολογουμένην κοινωνίαν</span>) by resisting Themistocles and Ephialtes as they tried to enact
     democratic reforms (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.6-8</span>).</div>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="Successes"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Cimon’s Successes</span></h2>
    
    <p>Cimon enjoyed this influence over affairs because he was a very
     successful general, politician, and perhaps self-promoter. After the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, when the Athenians were rebuilding their city (it
     had been sacked by the Persians in <span class="date">480</span>
     <span class="note" id="Note1"> [source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
       <span class="titlem">OCD</span>
       3
      </span>, see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Hdt.
       8.50.2</span>]</span>), Cimon acted on a message from the god Apollo, delivered to the Athenians through the oracle at Delphi; the message urged Athens
     to find the bones of their legendary king Theseus and return them
     for burial in Attica. Cimon
     found a large skeleton on the island of Scyros and returned
     with it, triumphantly, to Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span>
     36.1</span>-3; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 8.3</span>-7; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.17.6</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 3.3.7</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.98.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.60.2</span>). We also hear of Cimon and
      Aristides—both advocates of an aristocratic government (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      28.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.7</span>)—sent as an embassy to Sparta in <span class="date">479</span>, just after Athens and Sparta had led the Greeks in
     driving the Persians from Greece (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Arist.</span>
      10.10</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">Rhodes, 293</span>). According to Pausanias, Cimon was instrumental in
     fortifying the newly rebuilt Acropolis with
     walls (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus.
     1.28.3</span>).</p>
    <p>In the years <span class="date">478-477</span>, when the Persians has left the
     Greek mainland but were still a threat to the Greek islands in the Aegean, the Spartans held leadership of a coalition of Greek states united for
     protection from Persia (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 6.1</span>;
     source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
      <span class="titlem">OHCW</span>
     </span>). But the Spartan king Pausanias mismanaged the alliance,
     while Cimon, who was in the Aegean as an Athenian <span class="term">general</span> (<span class="foreign">στρατηγός</span>), acted fairly, thus helping to bring many island-states
     into alliance with Athens (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
     6.2</span>).</p>
    <p>Those years also marked the beginning of a series of naval battles between Persia and Athens, under the
     command of Cimon, that would, by <span class="date">467</span>,
     eliminate the Persian threat to the Greeks in the Aegean;
     the first of these battles was in the north, in Thrace,
     where Cimon attacked the Persians and liberated the city of
      Eion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 7.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.98.1</span>; source for
     date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
      <span class="titlem">OHCW</span>
     </span>). Pausanias (the writer from the <span class="date">2nd century CE</span>, no relation to the Spartan king of the same name) reports
     that Cimon pioneered the use of running water to undermine brick
     walls (which resist battering rams better than stone, he says) during the siege of Eion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 8.8.9</span>). Cimon’s victory at Eion in Thrace opened the way for Athens to control territory in northern Greece, including the city of Amphipolis
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
      8.2</span>).</p>
    <p>Cimon’s greatest moment, however, was in <span class="date">467</span>, when he commanded the Athenian fleet in a battle against the Persians near the
     mouth of the river Eurymedon (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
     12.1</span>-6; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc.
      1.100.1</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
      <span class="titlem">OHCW</span>
     </span>). After his fleet had beaten the Persian fleet, it landed troops which another victory
     on land (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 13.1</span>-2). Cimon won yet another victory
     immediately afterwards against a fleet of Phoenician ships that were part patrolling near
      Hydrus on behalf of Persia (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 13.3</span>). He became famous as the one general who won a victory on
     land and on sea on the same day (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 1.29.14</span>). The result of these victories was a treaty between the
     Greeks and the Great King of Persia, ending the Persian threat to the Greeks, at least for the moment (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
     13.4</span>).</p>
    <div class="p">Athens was still the leading city of the defensive
     alliance of Greek states, many of which grew tired of providing ships for the common defense;
     according to Plutarch, Cimon
     allowed them to pay money instead of contributing ships, money that the Athenians used to
     expand their own fleet, which would provide protection to all the allies. Thus, <span class="quote_inline">before
      they knew it, they were tribute-paying subject rather than allies</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
     11.1</span>-3; compare <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc.
      1.99</span>, which tells the same story without mentioning Cimon).
     This was the birth of the Athenian ‘empire’ (<span class="foreign">ἀρχή</span>) that would shape the city’s history in the <span class="date">5th
      century</span> (for the term, see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.67.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.75</span>).</div>
    <p>Plutarch tells the following story to illustrate Cimon’s prestige during these years when he was one of the ten <span class="term">generals</span> elected by the Athenians. On the occasion when the
     tragedian Sophocles was producing his first tragedies in the
      <span class="term">Theater of Dionysus</span>, putting them in
     competition with some tragedies of Aeschylus, the crowd was
     in an uproar, excited by the young poet’s challenge to the old master. When Cimon and his fellow <span class="term">generals</span> entered the theater, the
      <span class="term">archon</span> chose them to judge the competition, rather than
     selecting ten judges at random. Cimon’s reputation calmed the crowd
     and prevented a riot when the ‘upstart’
     Sophocles won the competition (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
     8.7</span>-8). This happened in <span class="date">468 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
      <span class="titlem">OHCW</span>
     </span>).</p>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="BeginningOfConflict"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">The Beginning of Conflict with the Democrats</span></h2>
    
    <p>Plutarch praises Cimon for his
     opposition to the democratic reforms of Themistocles and Ephialtes (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.7</span>). The beginnings of this opposition, as far as we can
     tell, arose from an incident on one of Cimon’s military campaigns in
     the north. While the Persians had been mostly driven from the Aegean sea, they remained in the Chersonese, a peninsula in the northern Aegean, and allied themselves with some of the people of Thrace; the Athenians dispatched Cimon to wage war
     against them (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 14.1</span>). Cimon won a victory in
      Thrace, which allowed him, had he wished to, to invade
      Macedonia. When he failed to do this, he was brought to
     trial in Athens, accused of accepting bribes to leave
      Macedonia alone; one of the prosecutors at his trial
     was Pericles (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 14.2</span>-3). Cimon
     spoke well in his own defense (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 14.3</span>) and was acquitted, but this trial, at least as Plutarch narrates Cimon’s career,
     marked the beginning of a period of confrontation between him and the democratic reformers
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
      15.1</span>-2; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.7</span>).</p>
    <p>Cimon was the <span class="term">proxenos</span> (<span class="foreign">πρόξενος</span>) or
      ‘official representative’ of Sparta in
      Athens, a position similar to that of an ambassador,
     except that the <span class="term">proxenus</span> was a citizen of the foreign city, not of the city he
     represented (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 14.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Paus. 4.24.6</span>). Cimon’s relationship with
      Sparta was close; he cited that relationship, as evidence
     of his good character, in his own defense at his trial (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
     14.3</span>), and even named one of his sons Lacedaemonius, or
      ‘Spartan’ (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.45.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 16.1</span>; Aristotle makes some
     unflattering comments about Cimon’s children at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Rh.</span>
      1390b</span>). This relationship was helpful to Athens,
     and reflected well on Cimon in the eyes of his fellow citizens,
     while Sparta and Athens
     were allies in the struggle against Persia, but as the two
     cities became rivals, Sparta’s <span class="term">proxenus</span> came
     to be regarded with some suspicion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 16.4</span>-6).</p>
    <div class="p">In <span class="date">464 BCE</span>, an earthquake struck the Peloponnese in the area around Sparta, and
     the <em>helots</em> (<span class="foreign">εἵλως</span>, <span class="foreign">εἱλώτης</span>), a large population of serfs controlled by the Spartans, took the disaster
     as an opportunity to revolt from their masters; the Spartans send messages to Athens asking for help in putting down this rebellion (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>

      <span class="titlem">OHCW</span>
     </span>). Aristophanes makes a joking reference to this event
     in his play <span class="titlem">Lysistrata</span>, where Lysistrata chides some
     Spartans, saying: <blockquote class="quote"><p>You must remember, not so long ago, you sent a man to Athens begging us, on bended knee and whiter than a ghost, to sent
      an army? All your slaves were up in arms when that big earthquake hit you. We send you help,
      four thousand infantry</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Lys.</span> 1138</span>)—<span class="quote_inline">not so long ago</span> is misleading,
     since <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">

    <div class="p">Ephialtes opposed sending help to Sparta, but Cimon argued in favor of doing so and
     persuaded the Athenians (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.

     help from Athens a second time, in <span class="date">462

     date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">

Plutarch says, <span class="quote_inline">the army came back home in a rage,

      against Cimon</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>

      <span class="term">ostracism</span> at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 17.2</span>, he suggests that it was motivated by
      Athens’ anger at their humiliating dismissal by the
      Spartans—Cimon, the <span class="term">proxenus</span> of Sparta would have been a natural target for that anger. But there may
     have been more to it than that. We have reason to think that while Cimon was away in Messenia with an Athenian
     army, the people in Athens, under the leadership of Ephialtes and Pericles, enacted a radical
     democratic reform by limiting the powers of the <span class="term">Court of the
      Areopagus</span>.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="ReformsBehindBack"><h2><span class="headingNumber">6. </span><span class="head">Democratic Reforms Behind Cimon’s Back</span></h2>
    
    <div class="p">First there is the question of why the Spartans, after summoning the Athenians to help,
     suddenly changed their minds and dismissed them. Plutarch
     says that the Spartans saw the Athenians as <span class="quote_inline">revolutionaries</span> (<span class="foreign">νεωτεριστάς</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 17.2</span>). Thucydides expands on this, saying that the Spartans, <blockquote class="quote"><p>apprehensive of the
      enterprising and revolutionary character of the Athenians, and further looking upon them as
      foreigners, began to fear that if they remained, they might be tempted by the besieged in
       Ithome to attempt some political changes. They
      accordingly dismissed them alone of the allies, without declaring their suspicions, but merely
      saying that they had now no need of them</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">δείσαντες τῶν
      Ἀθηναίων τὸ τολμηρὸν καὶ τὴν νεωτεροποιίαν, καὶ ἀλλοφύλους ἅμα ἡγησάμενοι, μή τι, ἢν
      παραμείνωσιν, ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν Ἰθώμῃ πεισθέντες νεωτερίσωσι, μόνους τῶν ξυμμάχων ἀπέπεμψαν, τὴν μὲν
      ὑποψίαν οὐ δηλοῦντες, εἰπόντες δὲ ὅτι οὐδὲν προσδέονται αὐτῶν ἔτι</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.102</span>).</div>
    <div class="p">Second, there are several passages from ancient authors that say that democratic reforms were
     passed in Athens while Cimon was
     away. Plutarch suggests this, in very general terms, in his
     biography of Pericles. Once Aristides was
     dead, Plutarch says, and Themistocles was banished and Cimon was generally absent on
     campaigns, <blockquote class="quote"><p>Pericles decided to devote himself to the people,
      espousing the cause of the poor and the many instead of the few and the rich, contrary to his
      own nature, which was anything but popular</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 7.2</span>).
     In his biography of Cimon he is more specific, saying that after
      Cimon’s trial and acquittal, he opposed any democratic reforms,
      <blockquote class="quote"><p>but when he sailed away again on military service, the <span class="term">People</span> got completely beyond control. They confounded the established political order
      of things and the ancestral practices which they had formerly observed, and under the lead of
       Ephialtes they robbed the <span class="term">Council of the
       Areopagus</span> of all but a few of the cases in its jurisdiction</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
     15.1</span>).</div>
    <div class="p">Third, there is evidence to suggest that democratic reforms, and particularly a reform of the
      <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>, were enacted specifically by the
      <span class="term">People</span> generally, the dēmos (<span class="foreign">δῆμος</span>), in the absence of Cimon and the wealthier
     Athenians. Diodorus says that it was the <span class="term">Assembly</span> (<span class="foreign">ἐκκλησία</span>), the most
     democratic institution in Athens, that reformed the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Diod. 11.77.6</span>). More
     interesting still, Aristotle attributes the democratic
     reforms after the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, and particularly the
     changes to the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>, to the <span class="quote_inline">naval
      multitude</span> (<span class="foreign">ὁ ναυτικὸς ὄχλος</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Pol.</span>
      1304a</span>). This <span class="quote_inline">naval multitude</span> refers to the citizens who were not wealthy
     enough to provide themselves with bronze armor, but could nevertheless serve as rowers on
     warships.</div>
    <div class="p">Fourth, and finally, Plutarch’s biography of Pericles, unlike his biography of Cimon,
     explicitly connects Cimon’s ostracism with Ephialtes’ reform of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>,
     which he calls here the ‘
      <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>
     ’: <blockquote class="quote"><p> Not only was the Council robbed of most of its jurisdiction by Ephialtes, but Cimon also, on the charge of
      being a lover of Sparta and a hater of the <span class="term">people</span>, was <span class="term">ostracized</span></p></blockquote>
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span>
      9.4</span>).</div>
    <p>If we put these four categories of evidence together, we might (tentatively) reconstruct
     events as follows: In <span class="date">462 BCE</span> the Spartans sent for Athenian help
     during the siege of Ithome in Messenia. Cimon marched south with an army that
     consisted of those Athenians wealthy enough to afford the bronze armor necessary for fighting
     on land. While this army was gone, the <span class="term">Assembly</span> at Athens, with a smaller-than-usual number of wealthy citizens
     participating, passed democratic reforms, including a reform of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>. Word of this reached Sparta, and the Spartans (who did not look kindly on reform, certainly not
     democratic reform) decided that the Athenians were dangerous to have around and so dismissed
     them. Upon returning to Athens, Cimon, who was known for his good relationship with Sparta and for opposing reforms such as had just been passed, was <span class="term">ostracized</span>.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that the preceding paragraph is one possible interpretation of a few
     pieces of evidence. The evidence, by itself, does not give a full, or consistent, picture of
     events.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="OpposedReforms"><h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">The Reforms that Cimon Opposed</span></h2>
    
    <p>For a full description of the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>
     (sometimes called the ‘Council of the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>,’ and sometimes simply ‘the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>’, after the Hill of the
      Areopagus, where it convened) and the reforms of <span class="date">462 BCE</span>, see
     the entries under <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> and Ephialtes. What follows is a very condensed account, to illustrate the
     democratic changes to the government of Athens that Cimon opposed.</p>
    <div class="p">In the earliest stages of the Athenian government that our sources describe, the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span> was the most important governing body. It
     was also a very aristocratic body. Aristotle says that before
     the <span class="date">fifth century</span>, <blockquote class="quote"><p>The <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> had the official function of guarding the laws, but actually
      it administered the greatest number and the most important of the affairs of state, inflicting
      penalties and fines upon offenders against public order without appeal; for the elections of
      the <span class="term">Archons</span> went by birth and wealth, and the members of the
       <span class="term">Areopagus</span> were appointed from them, owing to which this
      alone of the offices has remained even to the present day tenable for life</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      3.6</span>). In the time of Draco, who (according to legend) first
     gave Athens a code of laws, <blockquote class="quote"><p>The <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> was guardian of he laws, and kept a watch
      on the magistrates (<span class="foreign">τὰς ἀρχάς</span>) to make them govern in
      accordance with the laws. A person unjustly treated might lay a complaint before the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>, stating the law in contravention of
      which he was treated unjustly</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 4.4</span>). Both of these passages are
     rather vague as to the details of the functions of the <span class="term">Court of the
      Areopagus</span>, but its importance is clear.</div>
    <p>As Athens became gradually more democratic, in the years
     leading up to the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span> (c. <span class="date">481-479 BCE</span>: source <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
      <span class="titlem">OHCW</span>
     </span>), the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> seems to have lost some of its
     authority. Aristotle says in his <span class="titlem">Politics</span> that
      Solon—the partly legendary, partly historical Athenian lawgiver of
     the <span class="date">early 6th century BCE</span> (source: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
      <span class="titlem">OCD</span>
      3
     </span>)—reformed the Athenian constitution by mixing democratic elements (the <span class="term">law-courts</span>), aristocratic elements (the <span class="term">elected offices</span>) and oligarchic elements (the <span class="term">Council of the
      Areopagus</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
       <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1273b</span>). However, during the chaos of the Persian invasion in <span class="date">480 BCE</span>, the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>
     took a leading role in organizing, and financing, the evacuation of all Athenians to Salamis and the Peloponnese, which raised the body’s status considerably (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      23.1</span>).</p>
    <div class="p">While the evacuation of Athens raised the prestige of the
      <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, the ensuing battle in the sea by Salamis may have helped bring about its later fall from power. The
     victory at Salamis was won by Athens’ fleet, which was
     manned by the general population who may have assumed that their role in the defense of
      Athens entitled them to a greater role in the city’s
     governance. Aristotle explicitly contrasts this
      ‘naval crowd’ with the <span class="term">Council of the
      Areopagus</span>: <blockquote class="quote"><p>…as for example the <span class="term">Council of the
       Areopagus</span> having risen in reputation during the <span class="term">Persian
       Wars</span> was believed to have made the constitution more rigid, and then again the naval
      multitude, having been the cause of the victory off Salamis and thereby of the leadership of Athens due to her power at sea, made the democracy stronger</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">οἷον ἡ ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ βουλὴ εὐδοκιμήσασα ἐν τοῖς Μηδικοῖς ἔδοξε συντονωτέραν
      ποιῆσαι τὴν πολιτείαν, καὶ πάλιν ὁ ναυτικὸς ὄχλος γενόμενος αἴτιος τῆς περὶ Σαλαμῖνα νίκης καὶ
      διὰ ταύτης τῆς ἡγεμονίας διὰ τὴν κατὰ θάλατταν δύναμιν τὴν δημοκρατίαν ἰσχυροτέραν
      ἐποίησεν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
       <span class="titlem">Pol.</span> 1304a</span>).</div>
    <p>In the years following the <span class="term">Persian Wars</span>, we know of two
     events, particularly, that may have motivated the advocates of democracy to try to limit the
     authority of the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>. First, Themistocles, who was a leader of those who favored democracy (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      28.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 5.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.6</span>), was brought to trial before the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> on charges that he had improper dealings
     with Persia (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.3</span>). Second, Cimon, who as we have seen was an opponent of democratic reforms (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      28.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 5.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.6</span>), was acquitted by the <span class="term">Areopagus</span> when he was charged with failing to invade Macedonia (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 15.1</span>-2; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 10.7</span>).</p>
    <div class="p">The ancient sources are in agreement that in <span class="date">462 BCE</span>
     Cimon was the principle opponent of reform to the powers of the
      <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> (see, for example <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      26.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.4</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 15.1</span>; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
      <span class="titlem">OCD</span>
      3
     </span>). The sources do not agree, however, as to who initiated that reform. Plutarch says that it was Ephialtes
     who, <span class="quote_inline">broke down the power of the <span class="term">Council of the
       Areopagus</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 7.6</span>). At one point in the <span class="titlem">Constitution of the
      Athenians</span>
     Aristotle says <blockquote class="quote"><p>But as the population increased, Ephialtes son of Sophonides, having become
      head of the <span class="term">People</span> and having the reputation of being
      incorruptible and just in regard to the constitution, attacked the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span></p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.1</span>). But elsewhere in the same work
     he says that the reform was organized by Ephialtes and Themistocles (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 25.3</span>), and elsewhere still, he
     mentions Pericles attacking the <span class="term">Council of
      the Areopagus</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
       <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 27.1</span>). Plutarch also
     mentions Pericles at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.3</span>. We should probably conclude, although
     cautiously, that Ephialtes was the principle reformer, but that he
     acted with the advice and support of Pericles. Ephialtes is the name most often associated with the reforms, and the following
     passage from Plutarch suggests that, while Pericles was a leader of the democratic movement, it was Ephialtes who enacted this particular reform: <blockquote class="quote"><p>For this reason all
      the more did Pericles, strong in the affections of the <span class="term">people</span>, lead a successful party against the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span>. Not only was the Council robbed of most of its jurisdiction
      by Ephialtes, but Cimon also, on the
      charge of being a lover of Sparta and a hater of the <span class="term">people</span>, was <span class="term">ostracized</span>.</p></blockquote>
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span>
      9.4</span>).</div>
    <div class="p">What were the reforms? They are discussed at length in the articles on Ephialtes and on the <span class="term">Court of the Areopagus</span>, but they
     can be summarized briefly here. Plutarch says that the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> lost jurisdiction over almost all
      <em>kriseis</em>, <span class="quote_inline">judgements</span> (<span class="foreign">κρίσεις</span>)
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
      15.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.5</span>). Aristotle is vague, saying
     that the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> was <span class="quote_inline">deprived of
      superintendence of affairs</span> (<span class="foreign">ἀπεστερήθη τῆς
      ἐπιμελείας</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
       <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 26.1</span>). Our best evidence for what authority remained in the
     hands of the <span class="term">Council of the Areopagus</span> comes from subsequent
     trials that appeared before it. These include trials for homicide, assault and battery, certain
     religious offenses, and arson (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Lys.
      7.22</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 23.22</span>;
      <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 59.79</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      57.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot.
       <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span> 60.2</span>).</div>
    <p>Immediately after describing the reform of the <span class="term">Court of the
      Areopagus</span>, Aristotle mentions that Pericles first introduced pay for citizens who served on juries in the
     court of the <span class="term">Heliaia</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristot. <span class="titlem">Ath. Pol.</span>
      27.2</span>). This might indicate that, with many kinds of court cases no longer appearing
     before the <span class="term">Areopagus</span>, there was greater need for citizen
     jurors.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="Section" id="Death"><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">Cimon’s Last Years and Death</span></h2>
    
    <p>Cimon had been <span class="term">ostracized</span> in
      <span class="date">462</span>, which meant that he was exiled from Athens for ten years (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 17.2</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 4.33</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 3.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Per.</span> 9.4</span>).
     In <span class="date">458 BCE</span>, however, when Sparta
     and Athens were at war and facing each other for battle at
      Tanagra, Cimon volunteered
     himself to fight for the city. The Athenians refused his services, but when his tribe, the
      Oeneidae, fought well (though they died to the last
     man), the Athenians had a change of heart, and Pericles himself
     persuaded them to bring Cimon back from exile (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
     17.3</span>-6; source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary">
      <span class="titlem">OCD</span>
      3
     </span>).</p>
    <p>Around <span class="date">450 BCE</span>, Cimon negotiated a
     treaty between Athens and Sparta, thus (temporarily) bringing an end to the war (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.112.1</span>; see also the
     comments at <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.172</span>
     and <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 3.3</span>, which are not
     consistent).</p>
    <p>Cimon’s last years saw him return to the calling in which he had
     his greatest success, leading Athenian warships against Persian enemies. He led an Athenian
     military expedition to fight against the Persians in Egypt
      (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. <span class="titlem">Cim.</span>
      18.1</span>-7). He died at Citium, either from an illness
     or from a wound (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut.
       <span class="titlem">Cim.</span> 19.1</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Thuc. 1.112.4</span>).</p>
