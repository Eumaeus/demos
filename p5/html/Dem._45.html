 <p>Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Against Stephanus (I)</span>, see also Oratory. This is a speech on behalf of Apollodorus in
 a perjury suit that he has brought against Stephanus. It is the
 first of two speeches delivered during this same trial (see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 46</span>). Stephanus was a friend of Phormio (the same Phormio of <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 36</span>) who testified on Phormio’s behalf
 in the special plea (<span class="foreign">παραγραφή</span>) at the centre of that
 trial. The speeches <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 36</span>,
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 45</span> (this speech), and
 <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 46</span> all concern the
 estate of Pasion, an Athenian banker. According to Pasion’s will, Phormio, a
 former slave of Pasion, was given Pasion’s widow in marriage as well as control over Pasion’s business affairs until Pasion’s younger son, Pasicles, came of age.
 This arrangement did not work because Apollodorus’
 (the older son of Pasion) was constantly spending money from
 the common family fund. To correct this problem, and to ensure that young Pasicles would be left with an inheritance when he came of age,
 Phormio elected to distribute all of Pasion’s property equally between the two sons. This did not satisfy
 Apollodorus, who then sued Phormio
 for 3000 drachmas (see also <span class="term">Money</span>). He claimed that Phormio had withheld that sum of money when the property was
 distributed; the matter was submitted to arbitration and was it was decided that Phormio did indeed owe the money, which he then paid (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 36.3</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 36.14-15</span>). Twenty years passed, and
 Apollodorus decided that Phormio
 had defrauded him of 20 talents in bank-stock. Phormio, on the
 other hand, asserted that this was preposterous and filed a special plea to have this new
 suit dismissed, which is the direct concern of <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 36</span>. In that speech, Phormio asserts
 that, since twenty years have passed, the statue of limitations (<span class="foreign">τὸν τῆς προθεσμίας νόμον</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 36.26</span>) had expired and that Apollodorus had released him from any further financial obligations
 after he paid the 3000 drachmas. We learn in the present speech (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 45.1</span>) that Apollodorus suffered an embarrassing defeat
 in the previous case because, he claims, he has been <div class="cit">
 <div class="citbibl"></div>
 <div class="citquote">overwhelmed by false testimony</div>
 </div> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 45.1</span>; see also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 45.6</span>). Apollodorus now claims that the testimony of Phormio’s witnesses (specifically Stephanus)
 was false and that several of the documents produced by Phormio
 (the will of Pasion, Phormio’s lease of Pasion’s
 property, and Apollodorus’ statement releasing Phormio of further financial responsibility) were forged and should
 not be credited as evidence. Apollodorus further states that
 Stephanus has merely sided with Phormio because of possible monetary gain and that he has ignored a distant
 family tie to Apollodorus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 45.53-54</span>) which,
 according to Apollodorus’ notions of proper social
 practice (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 45.65</span>), would require that he support Apollodorus. Finally, he closes his speech with an attack on the character of
 Phormio, ridiculing his barbarian background and accusing him
 of carrying on an adulterous relationship with Archippe, Apollodorus’ mother, which resulted in the birth of Pasicles, Apollodorus’ younger
 brother (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 45.72-74</span>; also <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 45.83-84</span>). The speech closely resembles genuine works of Demosthenes stylistically. However, its authorship is
 disputed on the grounds that it would be strange (and perhaps unethical) for Demosthenes to write a speech in defence of Phormio (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem.
 36</span>) and then turn to write a speech (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 45</span>) attacking Phormio in the harshest
 terms. Plutarch expressly states that Demosthenes did
 write the speech (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plut. Dem. 15</span>) . Aeschines, a bitter political rival of Demosthenes, does accuse him of accepting money from Phormio to write a speech and then revealing its contents to Apollodorus (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.165</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 3.173</span>).
 However, were it known that Demosthenes had indeed
 written a speech for Apollodorus, we would expect Aeschines to mention it. We know that Pasion’s death is placed at <span class="date">370 BCE</span> (source
 for date: <span class="bibl">
 <span class="titlem">OCD</span>
 3
 </span>) and that the lawsuit that <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 36</span> is concerned with takes place about 20 years later, around <span class="date">350 BCE</span>. The present speech can be said to have taken place sometime
 after that.</p>
