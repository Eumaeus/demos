<p>This article was originally written for the online discussion series ‘Athenian Law in its Democratic Context,’ organized by Adriaan Lanni and sponsored by Harvard University’s <a class="link_ref" href="http://chs.harvard.edu">Center for Hellenic Studies</a>.</p>

<p>Lysias son of Cephalus (<span class="date">459/8-post 380</span>) was a <span class="term">metic</span> (a resident alien) whose father moved to Athens from Syracuse at the invitation of Pericles. As a teenager he moved to Thurii, where he studied rhetoric; he was banished after the Sicilian expedition ended in disaster and returned to Athens, where he and his brother Polemarchus prospered as owners of a shield-making business.</p>

<p>When the <span class="term">Thirty Tyrants</span> came to power in <span class="date">404/3</span>, they seized the brothers’ assets and put Polemarchus to death; Lysias barely escaped to Megara. Upon the restoration of the democracy in <span class="date">403</span>, Lysias was awarded Athenian <span class="term">citizenship</span> by a decree of Thrasybulus rewarding <span class="term">metics</span> who had aided the return of the exiled democrats; but the decree was soon repealed, and Lysias returned to metic status. Also in <span class="date">403</span> Lysias prosecuted the former tyrant Eratosthenes for the killing of Polemarchus. The verdict in the trial is unknown; but the speech Lysias delivered, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Eratosthenes’ (12)</span>, is one of the most important sources we have for the reign of the <span class="term">Thirty</span>, as is <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">‘Against Agoratus’ (13)</span>, written by Lysias for another litigant.</p>

<p>From <span class="date">403</span> to his death Lysias worked as a professional speechwriter. Of the hundreds of speeches ascribed to Lysias in antiquity, 35 survive today; in addition we have a number of fragments. Lysias composed speeches dealing with a wide variety of issues, ranging from <span class="term">homicide</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">1</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">12</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">13</span>) to intentional wounding (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">3</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">4</span>), slander (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">10</span>), <span class="term"><span class="term">dokimasiai</span></span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">26</span>, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">31</span>), and a disability pension (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">24</span>). Lysias’ prose was widely admired in antiquity for its <span class="term">charis</span> (grace, pleasantness) and <span class="term">ethopoiia</span> (portrayal of the speaker’s character).
