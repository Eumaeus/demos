<p>(Demosthenes, <span class="titlem">Against Apaturius</span>; see also Oratory). Demosthenes wrote this speech for man, whose name we do not know, who was defending himself in a lawsuit. The plaintiff in the lawsuit was Apaturius. The speech does not argue the case itself, but argues a ‘special plea’, a <span class="foreign">παραγραφή</span>, essentially a plea that the whole case be thrown out of court (see <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Dem. 33.2</span>). The speech argues that the lawsuit is baseless and malicious, but to prove that, the speak has to give many details about the history of the business between himself and Apaturius, so we know (at least one version of) much of what transpired. For the sake of telling the story, we will name the anonymous defendant, simply, Defendant.</p>
<p>Apaturius owned a shipt and some slaves. At one point he took out a loan for 40 minae, using his ship as collateral, but was unable to pay the loan back on schedule. Faced with having his ship seized in a foreclosure, he went to a man named Parmeno, who gave him 10 minae. Then he went to Defendant, who borrowed 30 minae from a bank owned by Heracleides. Defendant took the 30 minae he had borrowed and the 10 from Parmeno and paid off Apaturius’ loan. So now Defendant held a mortgage on Apaturius’ ship and slaves for 40 minae, but he also owed the bank of Heracleides 30 minae and owed Parmeno 10 minae.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Heracleides’ bank failed, and people to whom the bank owed money demanded the 30 minae that Defendant had owed the bank. Defendant signed his mortgage on Apaturius’ ship over to the bank's creditors, but with a lien of 10 minae, so Parmeno’s money was still secure. At this point, Parmeno caught Apaturius trying to sail his ship away from Athens in an attempt to avoid losing his ship. Since Apaturius’ escape would have cost Parmeno his 10 minae, Parmeno physically prevented him from taking the ship out of the harbor.</p>
<p>Eventually, Apaturius’ ship was sold for 40 minae, and all the debts were taken care of. But Apaturius and Parmeno sued each other, each claiming that the other had treated him violently during the confrontation over the ship. For a time it seemed that the matter would not go to trial, but would be handled by arbitration, but that arrangement fell through. But before the case could come to trial, Parmeno had to leave Athens because his family, living in the Chersonese, had been killed in an earthquake. While Parmeno was away, Apaturius came to court and won a default judgement against the absent Parmeno for 20 minae in damages.</p>
<p>Then Apaturius sued Defendant for those 20 minae, claiming that Defendant was responsible for Parmeno’s debt. That lawsuit is the occasion for this speech. Defendant is arguing that, first, he was not serving as security for Parmeno's debts, and, second, that the award granted to Apaturius against Parmeno was wrong. As is so often the case, we do not know whether this speech was successful or not.</p>
