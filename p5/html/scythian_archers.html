<p>In Athens the so-called ‘Scythian Archers,’ who may or may not have been from Scythia and who may or may not have been archers, served as a police force, keeping order in public gatherings (the <span class="term">Council</span>, the <span class="term">Assembly</span>, and the Agora) and perhaps authorized to use force against <span class="term">citizens</span> under certain circumstances.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Definition"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">Definition</span></h2>


<p>In Athens the so-called ‘Scythian Archers’ served as a police force. They were public<span class="term"> slaves</span> (<span class="foreign">δημόσιοι</span>) who served as guards (<span class="foreign">φύλακες</span>) or watchmen (<span class="foreign">ὕποπτοι</span>) in the city. There is very little evidence that provides any details about these, and what evidence we have is either from the <span class="date">5th century</span> comedy of Aristophanes—which is difficult evidence to interpret—or from ancient scholarship from many centuries later.</p>

<div class="p">The Suda, a historical encyclopedia from the <span class="date">10th century CE</span> has this to say about the word ‘archers’ (<span class="foreign">τοξόται</span>), in the context of classical Athens: <blockquote class="quote"><p>Archers: The public <span class="term">slaves</span>, guards of the city, in number 1000, who formerly lived in the Agora, camping out in the middle, but later moved to the Areopagus. These were called ‘Scythians’ and ‘Speusinioi,’ from a certain Speusinos, one of the ancient politicians, who organized their affairs</p></blockquote> (<span class="foreign">Τοξόται· οἱ δημόσιοι ὑπηρέται, φύλακες τοῦ ἄστεος, τὸν ἀριθμὸν χίλιοι, οἵτινες πρότερον μὲν ᾤκουν τὴν ἀγορὰν μέσην σκηνοποιησάμενοι, ὕστερον δὲ μετέβησαν εἰς Ἄρειον Πάγον, ἐκαλοῦντο δὲ οὗτοι καὶ Σκύθαι καὶ Σπευσίνιοι; ἀπὸ Σπευσίνου τινὸς τῶν πάλαι πολιτευομένων συντάξαντος τὰ περὶ αὐτούς</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Suda tau,772</span>; see also <span class="bibl">Schol. In Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Ach.</span> 54</span>, which is almost identical except for saying <span class="quote_inline">Peusinioi</span> and <span class="quote_inline">Peusinus</span> instead of <span class="quote_inline">Speuninioi</span> and <span class="quote_inline">Speusinos</span>; also <span class="bibl">Hescythius, 1137</span>; <span class="bibl">Schol.

<div class="Section" id="Origins"><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">Origins of the Scythian Archers in Athens</span></h2>


<div class="p">In nearly identical passages, the orators Andocides and Aeschines describe the origin of these Scythian Archers in Athens. According to Aeschines, after the battle of Salamis in <span class="date">490 BCE</span> (source for date: <span class="bibl bibl-secondary"><span class="titlem">OCD</span>3</span>), Athens <blockquote class="quote"><p>fortified the Piraeus and built the North Wall…. We also equipped three hundred <span class="term">cavalrymen</span> (<span class="foreign">ἱππεῖς</span>) and bought three hundred Scythians (<span class="foreign">τριακοσίους Σκύθας ἐπριάμεθα</span>)</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.173</span>). Andocides reports this same event, but specifies that these Scythians were <span class="term">archers</span>: <blockquote class="quote"><p>It was at this time that we first enrolled three hundred <span class="term">cavalry</span> (<span class="foreign">ἱππέας</span>) and purchased three hundred Scythian <span class="term">archers</span> (<span class="foreign">τοξότας τριακοσίους Σκύθας ἐπριάμεθα</span>)</p></blockquote> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 3.5</span>). Both Aeschines and Andocides seem to distinguish these Scythian Archers from the <span class="term">archers</span> of the <span class="term">Athenian militia</span>. After mentioning the Scythians, Aeschines goes on to say, <span class="quote_inline">We formed a corps of twelve hundred <span class="term">cavalry</span> and a new force of as many <span class="term">bowmen</span></span> (<span class="foreign">χιλίους δὲ καὶ διακοσίους ἱππέας κατεστήσαμεν καὶ τοξότας ἑτέρους τοσούτους</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.174</span>). Andocides likewise says, <span class="quote_inline">we enrolled twelve hundred <span class="term">cavalry</span> and as many <span class="term">archers</span></span> (<span class="foreign">χιλίους τε καὶ διακοσίους ἱππέας καὶ τοξότας τοσούτους ἑτέρους κατεστήσαμεν</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 3.7</span>). From this it would seem that the three hundred Scythian archers and the twelve hundred (unspecified) <span class="term">archers</span> were two distinct bodies.</div>
</div>


<div class="Section" id="Identity"><h2><span class="headingNumber">4. </span><span class="head">Identity of the Scythian Archers</span></h2>


<div class="p">Aeschines and Andocides both say that Athens originally bought ‘Scythians,’ people from Scythia, the territory to the north of the Black Sea (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aeschin. 2.173</span>; <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Andoc. 3.5</span>). It is possible that the Scythian archers did not always consist entirely of ethnic Scythians. A ‘scholion,’ or hand-written note in the margins of a manuscript of Aristophanes’ <span class="titlem">Lysistrata</span> says the Athenians <span class="quote_inline">used to call the public <span class="term">slaves</span> ‘Scythians’</span> (<span class="foreign">Σκύθας γὰρ καὶ τοξότας ἐκάλουν τοὺς δημοσίους ὑπηρέτας</span>), which leaves open the possibility that the name may also have applied to those who were not Scythians (<span class="bibl">Schol. In Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Lys.</span> 184</span>).</div>

<p>It seems clear that the ‘Scythian Archers’ were at least foreigners, not Athenians. Jokes in Aristophanes’ comedies often involve the Scythian Archers’ foreign accents (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span> 1002</span>):</p>

<p>Scythian Archer: But what’s your name?
<br />Euripides: Artemisia.
<br />Scythian Archer: I will remember it. Artemuxia.</p>

<p>The joke is that the Scythian archer, with his foreign accent, cannot pronounce the Greek name Artemisia.</p>
</div>

<div class="Section" id="Function"><h2><span class="headingNumber">5. </span><span class="head">The Function of the Scythian Archers</span></h2>


<div class="p">The literary accounts of the Scythian archers come primarily from the <span class="date">5th century</span> comedy of Aristophanes, and his treatment may be exaggerated or otherwise altered for comic effect. However, certain conclusions can be drawn from his plays. The Scythian Archers’ major role in Athenian society was to act as policemen for Athens. In Aristophanes’s plays we see them performing crowd control. In <span class="titlem">Ecclesiazusae</span> a character mentions <span class="quote_inline">the archers dragging more than one uproarious drunkard out of the market-place</span> (<span class="foreign">ἀγορά</span>) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Eccl.</span> 143</span>). In Aristophanes’s <span class="titlem">Knights</span> the <span class="term">Prytaneis</span> (often called ‘magistrates’ in translations) and the Scythians usher a man out of the <span class="term">Council</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Kn.</span> 665</span>). We also find scenes of Scythian archers beating disorderly people, sometimes with whips. In <span class="titlem">Thesmophoriazusae</span>, the Magistrate (<span class="term">‘Prytanis’</span>) says to a Scythian archer, <span class="quote_inline">A sound lash with your whip for him who attempts to break the order</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span> 923</span>). The Suda includes a quotation from Athenian literature that describes an <span class="quote_inline">archer</span> beating a man: <span class="quote_inline">I was distraught and had to wipe away tears when I saw a old man being beaten by another man, an archer</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Suda omega,243</span>). This last passage comes to us without context, and so we do not know of the victim was being ‘disorderly’ or not. Although the title ‘Scythian Archer’ suggests that they carried bows and arrows, there is no literary evidence showing these <span class="term">public slaves</span> using such weapons. The only weapons mentioned in the passages above are (non-lethal) whips.</div>

<div class="p">Aristophanes also presents several scenes in which Scythian archers arrest people. In the <span class="titlem">Acharnians</span>, the <span class="term">Magistrates</span> (or <span class="term">‘Prytaneis’</span>) are attempting to have the character Amphitheus (the name is translated ‘Godson’ in some translations) arrested by the Scythian Archers, (called <span class="quote_inline">Officers</span> in this translation) (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Ach.</span> 54</span>; see also <span class="bibl">Schol. In Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Ach.</span> 54</span>).</div>

<p>Herald: Officers!
<br />Godson: Triptolemus and Celeus, see my plight!
<br />Dicaeopolis: Oh Magistrates, gentlemen, this is out of line, arresting the man who wanted to help us get a treaty of peace, a chance for armistice!</p>


<div class="p">In <span class="titlem">Lysistrata</span> a Scythian archer confronts the title character, saying, <span class="quote_inline">Arrest this woman! Whoever’s on this outing I’ll arrest</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Lys.</span> 445</span>). We also see the Scythian archers handcuffing or tying up offenders. In <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Lysistrata</span> line 434</span>, the <span class="term">Prytanis</span> calls for the Scythian archers, saying, <span class="quote_inline">I’m calling a policeman. Arrest this woman, put the handcuffs on. ...Go on and grab her. And you there, help him out. Hog-tie this woman!</span> In the <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn"><span class="titlem">Thesmophoriazusae</span></span>, the <span class="term">Prytanis</span> says, <span class="quote_inline">Officer <span class="note" id="Note1"> [in Greek, ‘Archer’ (<span class="foreign">τοξότε</span>)]</span>, arrest him, fasten him to the post, then take up your position there and keep guard over him</span> (<span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Aristoph. <span class="titlem">Thes.</span> 923</span>).</div>

<p>Although there is evidence for a <span class="term">jail</span> (<span class="foreign">δεσμωτήριον</span>) and a jail-warden (<span class="foreign">ὁ τοῦ δεσμωτηρίου φύλαξ</span>) in classical Athens, we do not have any evidence connecting the Scythian Archers with it (see, for example, <span class="bibl bibl-cts-urn">Plat. <span class="titlem">Crito</span> 43a</span>).</p>
