    <head>Summary</head>
    <p><term>Apophasis</term> refers to an investigation into serious threats to the Athenian
     democracy, especially treason and bribery, although there is some evidence for it being used
     for lesser offenses. This investigation involved several branches of the Athenian government:
     the <term sortKey="Assembly">Assembly</term>, the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>,
     and the <term sortKey="lawcourt">People’s Court</term>. This procedure, an innovation of the
      <date from="-0345" to="-0323">later 4th century BCE</date>, began with an investigation
     conducted by the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>, which would issue a report. The
     report was called an <term>apophasis</term> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόφασις</foreign>).
     Eventually, the whole procedure—investigation, report, prosecution—came to be known by this
     term. When the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> issued its report on suspected
     treason or bribery, it included a recommendation, either to prosecute certain parties or not
     to. If the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> recommended prosecution, the <term
      sortKey="Assembly">Assembly</term> would appoint prosecutors, and the matter would be tried
     before the <term sortKey="lawcourt">People’s Court</term>. The different institutions seem to
     have served to balance each other, and we hear of several cases in which the <term
      sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> recommended conviction, but the <term sortKey="Assembly"
      >Assembly</term> or <term sortKey="lawcourt">People’s Court</term> acquitted the
     defendant.</p>

    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p><term>Apophasis</term> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπόφασις</foreign>) refers to a report issued
     by the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> after the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
      >Areopagus</term> had investigated a matter of bribery or treason (see, for example, <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:1" type="cts-urn">Din. 1.1</bibl>). But this report was
     merely one part of an involved process of investigation and prosecution that involved the <term
      sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>, the <term sortKey="Assembly">Assembly</term>, and the
      <term sortKey="lawcourt">People’s Court</term>. The best evidence for this procedure comes
     from <name type="ancientAuthor">Dinarchus</name>’ speech prosecuting <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Demosthenes</name> for allegedly having taken bribes from <name type="person"
     >Harpalus</name>, a Macedonian (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:1" type="cts-urn">Din.
      1.1</bibl>). In this speech, <name type="ancientAuthor">Dinarchus</name> concisely describes
     the procedure for an <term>apophasis</term>, and describes how the different institutions of
     the Athenian government worked together. He begins by saying that, <quote>The council of the
       <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> is bound, gentlemen, to follow one of two methods
      in making all its reports (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰς ἀποφάσεις πάσας</foreign>)</quote>
      (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:50" type="cts-urn">Din. 1.50</bibl>). He spends a
     couple of sentences criticizing <name type="ancientAuthor">Demosthenes</name>, then returns to
     characterize the current procedings: <quote>Compare the present case, where you have both a
      decree <note place="inline" rend="bracket" resp="CWB"><foreign xml:lang="grc"
        >ψήφισμα</foreign>, passed by the <term sortKey="Assembly">Assembly</term></note> which

    <head>Aphophasis First Appears in the later 4th century</head>
    <p>In a speech delivered in <date when="-0323">323 BCE</date>, <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Dinarchus</name> refers to a decree, moved in the <term sortKey="Assembly">Assembly</term> by
      <name type="ancientAuthor">Demosthenes</name>, that that <term sortKey="Areopagus"
      >Areopagus</term> should investigate a matter of bribery <quote>as was its traditional
      right</quote> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὡς αὐτῇ πάτριόν ἐστι</foreign>) (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:4" type="cts-urn">Din. 1.4</bibl>; source for date: <bibl
      type="secondary">Hansen, 292</bibl>). But we do not have much other evidence that the <term
      sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> regularly investigated matters of bribery. When <name
      type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name> describes the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
      >Areopagus’</term> duties in the <date from="-0399" to="-0300">4th century</date>, he says
     that, <quote>Trials for deliberate murder and wounding are held in the <term
       sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>, and for causing death by poison, and for arson</quote>
      (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg003:57.3" type="cts-urn">Aristot. <title>Ath.
       Pol.</title> 57.3</bibl>; <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg023:22" type="cts-urn">Dem.
      23.22</bibl>).</p>
    <p>There is however some evidence for the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> issuing
     reports to the <term sortKey="Assembly">Assembly</term> apart from the procedure we call
      <term>apophasis</term>. Sometime before <date when="-0343">343 BCE</date>, we hear of the
      <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> reporting to the <term sortKey="Assembly"
      >Assembly</term> on the matter of some dwellings on the <name n="Pnyx, Athens" type="site"
      >Pnyx</name> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:81" type="cts-urn">Aeschin.
     1.81</bibl>; source for date: <bibl type="secondary">Harris, <title>Aeschines and Athenian
       Politics</title></bibl>).</p>
    <p>But this is not called an <term>apophasis</term>, and does not seem to have been similar to
     the later procedure. In fact, none of the evidence from <name type="ancientGenre"
      >oratory</name> before the <date from="-0350" to="-0300">second half of the 4th century</date>
     mention <term>apophasis</term> (this includes the orators <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Andocides</name>, <name type="ancientAuthor">Isaeus</name>, <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Antiphon</name>, <name type="ancientAuthor">Lysias</name>, <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Isocrates</name>, <name type="ancientAuthor">Lycurgus</name>, and <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Aeschines</name>). <name type="ancientAuthor">Demosthenes</name> uses the term several times,
      (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg018:60" type="cts-urn">Dem. 18.60</bibl>, <bibl

      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg041:30" type="cts-urn">Dem. 41.30</bibl>, <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg047:45" type="cts-urn">Dem. 47.45</bibl>), but in each case he
     seems to use the word generically, <soCalled>an account</soCalled>, such as someone might give
     when returning from a voyage, or (often) when itemizing an estate so the inheritance can be
     settled.</p>
    <p>In <name type="ancientAuthor">Demosthenes</name> speech <soCalled>On the Crown,</soCalled>
     delivered in <date when="-0330">330 BCE</date> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg018"
      type="cts-urn">Dem. 18</bibl>; source for date: <bibl type="secondary">
      <title>OCD</title>
      <edition>3</edition>
     </bibl>), he mentions two events that might be the first instances of <term>apophasis</term>,
     although he does not use the term. <name type="ancientAuthor">Demosthenes</name> mentions a man
     named <name type="person">Antiphon</name> (not the orator <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Antiphon</name>) who had been exiled from <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName>, and
     then apprehended at the port of the <placeName key="Piraeus">Piraeus</placeName>; he was
     acquitted, either by the <term sortKey="lawcourt">People’s Court</term> or by the <term
      sortKey="Assembly">Assembly</term>, but the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>
     investigated the matter and secured his conviction (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg018:133" type="cts-urn">Dem. 18.133</bibl>). Then, <name
      type="ancientAuthor">Demosthenes</name> describes how <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Aeschines</name>, having been selected to be an ambassador by the <term sortKey="Assembly"
      >Assembly</term>, was investigated by the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>, which
      <quote>rejected him as a traitor</quote> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπήλασεν ὡς
      προδότην</foreign>) (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg018:134" type="cts-urn">Dem.
      18.134</bibl>). There is some reason to think that these might be the first attested instances
     of the procedure we call <term>apophasis</term>. <name type="ancientAuthor">Dinarchus</name>,
     in a speech seven years later, mentions the case of <name type="person">Antiphon</name> and
     says that he was tortured and killed as a result of the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
      >Areopagus</term>’ <term>apophasis</term> (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐστρέβλωσαν Ἀντιφῶντα καὶ
      ἀπέκτειναν οὗτοι τῇ τῆς βουλῆς ἀποφάσει πεισθέντες</foreign>) (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:63" type="cts-urn">Din. 1.63</bibl>). He then says that
      <name type="ancientAuthor">Demosthenes</name> himself had been instrumental in giving this
     authority to the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>, citing the cases not only of <name
      type="person">Antiphon</name>, but also of a descendant of the hero <name type="person"
      >Aristogiton</name>, and a man named <name type="person">Charinus</name> (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:63" type="cts-urn">Din. 1.63</bibl>). So we can conclude
     that the procedure probably came into existence before <date when="-0330">330</date>, and came
     to be referred to as <term>apophasis</term> before <date when="-0323">323 BCE</date> (source
     for dates: <bibl type="secondary">Hansen, 292</bibl>).</p>

    <head><term>Apophasis</term> invoked for cases of treason, bribery, and attempts to overthrow
     the democracy, but also for lesser crimes</head>
    <p>In <name type="ancientAuthor">Dinarchus</name>’ speech against <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Demosthenes</name>, part of an <term>apophasis</term>, the orator’s rhetoric suggests that
     the trial was about more than bribery (the actual accusation; see <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:1" type="cts-urn">Din. 1.1</bibl>), but was about the
     security of the Athenian democracy. <name type="ancientAuthor">Dinarchus</name> says that
     anyone who would defend <name type="ancientAuthor">Demosthenes</name> is an enemy of <placeName
      key="Athens">Athens</placeName>: <quote>And whenever anyone comes forward to speak for him,
      bear in mind that he who does so, even if not involved in the reports [<foreign xml:lang="grc"
       >ἀποφάσεσιν</foreign>] we are about to hear, is hostile to the constitution, unwilling to see
      punished those who take bribes against the <term sortKey="People">people</term> and anxious
      that the general protection of your persons, for which the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
       >Areopagus</term> is responsible, should be abolished and every right in the city
      overwhelmed</quote> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:112" type="cts-urn">Din.
      1.112</bibl>). According to <name type="ancientAuthor">Dinarchus</name>, the <term
      sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> investigated the question of bribery because any case of
     Macedonians bribing prominent Athenians would put the city in danger (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:3-4" type="cts-urn">Din. 1.3-4</bibl>).</p>
    <p><term>Apophasis</term> was also used in cases when the city itself was thought to be in
     danger from some external enemy. <name type="person">Antiphon</name> was the subject of
      <term>apophasis</term> because, after being exiled as a spy and saboteur for the Macedonians,
     he was caught back in <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName> (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg018:132" type="cts-urn">Dem. 18.132</bibl>; <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:63" type="cts-urn">Din. 1.63</bibl>). A man named <name
      type="person">Polyeuctus</name> of <name n="Cydantidae" type="deme">Cydantidae</name> was the
     subject of an <term>apophasis</term> because he had made suspicious trips to <placeName
      key="Megara">Megara</placeName> (although he was cleared of all suspicion when it was
     discovered that he had relatives there) (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:58"
      type="cts-urn">Din. 1.58</bibl>). And <name type="person">Charinus</name> was exiled, after an
      <term>apophasis</term>, on a charge of treason (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ
     προδοσίᾳ</foreign>) (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:63" type="cts-urn">Din.
      1.63</bibl>).</p>
    <p>In a brief passage, however, <name type="ancientAuthor">Dinarchus</name> mentions some lesser
     offenses that were first brought before the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> and then
     referred to a <term sortKey="lawcourt">jury</term>—a defendant who robbed the captain of a
     ferry-boat, someone fraudulently collecting five drachmas (a public subsidy for attending the
      <term sortKey="Theater_of_Dionysus,_Athens">theater</term>), and a member of the <term
      sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> who was given a portion of meat from a public sacrifice
     (a benefit of service on the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>) who sold the portion
     illegally (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:56" type="cts-urn">Din. 1.56</bibl>). </p>

    <p>After the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> issued its report, the

     sequence of events: <quote>In the case of <name type="person">Polyeuctus</name> of <name
       n="Cydantidae" type="deme">Cydantidae</name>, when the people instructed the Council of the
       <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> to inquire whether he was accompanying the exiles
      to <placeName key="Megara">Megara</placeName> and to report back after the investigation, it
      reported that he was doing so. You chose accusers as the law prescribes: <name type="person"
       >Polyeuctus</name> came into court and you acquitted him, on his admitting that he was going
      to <placeName key="Megara">Megara</placeName> to <name type="person">Nicophanes</name> who, he
      said, was married to his mother</quote> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:58"
      type="cts-urn">Din. 1.58</bibl>). Here, the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>
     reported that the man had gone to <placeName key="Megara">Megara</placeName> with some exiles,
     and was thus suspected of treason. Because of this report, accusers were chosen to prosecute
     the case before a <term sortKey="lawcourt">court</term>.</p>
    <p>It seems that the <term sortKey="Assembly">Assembly</term> had to vote on whether to take a
     case to <term sortKey="lawcourt">court</term> as a result of the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
      >Areopagus</term>’ <term>apophasis</term>. In a speech prosecuting <name type="person"

      the Council of the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> to have taken bribes against
      your interests… and the <term sortKey="People">People</term> have, by a show of hands, handed

      >Assembly</term> voted on whether to send a defendant to be tried in front of a <term
      sortKey="lawcourt">jury</term>, it would also elect, by show of hands, one or more prosecuters

    <p>It is clear that the ultimate decision—to punish the defendant or not to—was in the hands of
     the <term sortKey="lawcourt">jury</term>. <name type="ancientAuthor">Dinarchus</name> mentions
     many cases of defendants who were found guilty by the <term sortKey="Areopagus"

      sortKey="lawcourt">jury</term> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:57-59" type="cts-urn"

       key="Megara">Megara</placeName> to <name type="person">Nicophanes</name> who, he said, was
      married to his mother. So you did not consider that he was doing anything strange or
      reprehensible in keeping in touch with his mother’s husband who was in difficulties, or in
      assisting him, so far as he could, while he was banished from the country</quote> (<bibl

    <head>The advantage of a complex system of investigation</head>
    <p>The case of <name type="person">Polyeuctus</name> illustrates the advantage of the complex
     procedure of investigation that came to be called <term>apophasis</term>. By having the <term
      sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> investigate the facts of a case, and a <term
      sortKey="lawcourt">jury</term> decide on punishment, the Athenians considered themselves to
     have struck a balance between impersonal judgement and a more personal justice. <name
      type="ancientAuthor">Dinarchus</name> says this explicitly. In his speech against <name
      type="ancientAuthor">Demosthenes</name>, he explains why, in other cases, the <term
      sortKey="lawcourt">jury</term> overrode the findings of the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
      >Areopagus</term>: <quote>There is an explanation for this which you will easily follow. The
      council of the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>, gentlemen, has its own method of
      inquiring into the cases which you assign to it and the crimes committed within its own body.
      Unlike yourselves—and you need not take offence at this—who are sometimes apt when judging to
      give more weight to mercy than to justice, it simply reports anyone who is liable to the
      charges in question or has broken any traditional rule of conduct, believing that if a person
      is in the habit of committing small offences he will more easily involve himself in serious
      crimes</quote> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:54-55" type="cts-urn">Din.
      1.54-55</bibl>). He mentions a few examples of people found guilty by the <term
      sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term>, and then turned over to the <term sortKey="lawcourt"
      >jury</term>: <quote>You tried these men and acquitted them. You were not thereby convicting
      the <term sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> of error but you were more concerned with
      sympathy than justice, and thought the punishment too severe for the offence which the
      defendants had committed</quote> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:56" type="cts-urn"
      >Din. 1.56</bibl>). He concludes this explanation with the story of <name type="person"
      >Polyeuctus</name> (<bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:58" type="cts-urn">Din.
      1.58</bibl>), which he sums up by saying: <quote>The report of the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
       >Areopagus</term>… was not proved false; it was quite true, but the <term sortKey="lawcourt"
       >jury</term> decided to acquit <name type="person">Polyeuctus</name>. The council <note
       place="inline" rend="bracket" resp="CWB">of the <term sortKey="Areopagus"
       >Areopagus</term></note> was instructed to discover the truth, yet, as I say, the <term
       sortKey="lawcourt">court</term> decided whether it was a case for pardon</quote> (<bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0029.tlg001:59" type="cts-urn">Din. 1.59</bibl>).</p>
    <p><name type="ancientAuthor">Dinarchus</name>’s arguments are successful in suggesting that the
     procedure of <term>apophasis</term>—which involved the less democratic institution of the <term
      sortKey="Areopagus">Areopagus</term> and the more democratic <term sortKey="Assembly"
      >Assembly</term> and <term sortKey="lawcourt">People’s Court</term>—was flexible and
     potentially fair.</p>
