<head ><bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg027' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 27</bibl></head>
<p >(<name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, <title >Against <name  type='person'>Aphobus</name> I</title>; see also <name  n='oratory' type='ancientGenre'>Oratory</name>). <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’ father, who was also named <name  type='person'>Demosthenes</name>, died when his son was seven and left a large estate in the hands of three trustees, <name  type='person'>Aphobus</name>, <name  type='person'>Demophon</name>, and <name  type='person'>Therippides</name>. <name  type='person'>Aphobus</name> was to marry the widow, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’ mother, and receive 80 minae as a dowry (see <term  sortKey='Money'>Money</term>). <name  type='person'>Demophon</name> was to marry the young daughter, once she came to be old enough (she was only five when her father died); he was to receive a dowry of 2 talents at the time of the marriage. <name  type='person'>Therippides</name> was to manage the estate, earning a salary for his work, until the younger <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> came of age. But, it seems, these three men followed none of these instructions, but squandered the money, so that when young <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> turned 17 only one tenth of the original estate remained. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> studied for two years under the orator <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Isaeus</name>, and then initiated three lawsuits against the three trustees. The first one, against <name  type='person'>Aphobus</name>, came to trial in <date  when='-0364'>364 BCE</date>. <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg027' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 27</bibl>, the first speech against <name  type='person'>Aphobus</name>, was <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’ initial prosecution of the trustee. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> won this case, and the jury ordered <name  type='person'>Aphobus</name> to pay 10 talents in damages. But <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> had difficulty collecting the damages from <name  type='person'>Aphobus</name>. Two subsequent speeches, <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg028' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 28</bibl> and <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg029' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 29</bibl>, were given by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> in his efforts to recover his money (see also <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg030' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 30</bibl> and <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg031' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 31</bibl>, both against <name  type='person'>Onetor</name>, a brother-in-law of <name  type='person'>Aphobus</name>).
