<head ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Philochorus</name></head>
<p > <date  from='-0340' to='-0260'>c.340-260 BCE</date> (Source: <bibl  n='OCD3'><title >OCD</title><edition >3</edition></bibl>). One of the so-called <soCalled >Atthidographers</soCalled>, the ancient scholars who wrote histories of <placeName  key='Attica'>Attica</placeName> and <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> (see <name  n='history' type='ancientGenre'>History</name>). He wrote at least twenty-seven works, including histories of <placeName  key='Delos'>Delos</placeName> and <placeName  key='Salamis'>Salamis</placeName>, works on sacrifice and cults, and studies of Greek poetry. His most famous work was his history of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>, his <bibl  n='Philoch. Atthis'>Atthis</bibl>. This work does not survive, but we do have over 170 <soCalled >fragments</soCalled> of it, quotations from the work in other, surviving, ancient authors. He seems to have exercised critical judgement when choosing his sources; he approved of his predecessor <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Androtion</name>, but was critical of the historian <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demon</name> and even devoted a book to pointing out <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demon</name>’s faults. Based on the fragments that survive, we can tell that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Philochorus</name> was familiar with <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Herodotus</name> and <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Thucydides</name>. He was put to death by <name  type='person'>Antigonus Gonatas</name> around <date  when='-0260'>260 BCE</date>, for supporting <name  type='person'>Ptolemy II Philadelphus</name>. </p>
