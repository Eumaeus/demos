    <head>Summary</head>
    <p>Ancient Greek democracy has regularly attracted the attention of modern political scientists
     as part of the discussion of the theory and practice of democratic systems of government. By
     far the most important ancient text for this discussion is the <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl> of <name type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name>. Studying what <name
      type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name> has to say about democracy in the <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl> is challenging for several reasons. First of all, his remarks on the subject are spread
     widely throughout this extended work. The challenge is further increased by the discursive
     character of <name type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name>’s arguments in the
      <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl>, which for one thing mix discussions of theoretical principles for systems of
     government with observations about actual Greek states of <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Aristotle</name>’s time (and before it). Finally, there is the strong
     possibility that the traditionally accepted order of the eight <soCalled>Books</soCalled> or
     chapters of the <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl> is not the order in which <name type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name> meant his
     arguments to be presented.</p>
   </div>
   <div n="Introduction" type="Section" xml:id="Introduction">
    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p>The goal of this article is to provide one possible aid for those wishing to meet this
     challenge. It therefore offers a series of topical headings under which selected passages
     relevant to the study of democracy in the <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a"
      type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl> are rearranged. That is, under each topic the passages are listed not in the order in
     which they occur in the <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl>, but are instead arranged in an order that attempts to suggest connections in thought
     between <name type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name>’s various remarks on
     democracy. The passages are paraphrased rather than translated word for word, although the
     paraphrases of the shorter excerpts attempt to stay as close to the Greek wording as is
     practical. Since the paraphrased passages are meant to serve as jumping-off points for
     consideration of the full text of the <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a"
      type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl>, each passage has an active link to the full text of the <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl>. A <term sortKey="aristotle_democracy@Glossary">glossary of Greek terms</term> and a
     very selective <term sortKey="aristotle_democracy@Bibliography">bibliography</term> of
     recommended print readings are also included.</p>
    <p>Since the approach adopted for this site rearranges the order of material on democracy from
     the <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl>, it necessarily removes each passage from its context in order to suggest connections
     in thought that might not be easy to grasp when the text is read serially from beginning to
     end. This displacement of the passages suggests an interpretation of the connections in <name
      type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name>’s thought on democracy in the <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl>. The potential danger of this method, of course, is that reading excerpted and
     paraphrased passages without considering their full context can be seriously misleading. It
     must be strongly emphasized, therefore, that reading the <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl> thoroughly from beginning to end (and more than once!) is the only way to try to
     understand fully its complex and interwoven arguments. With this caution firmly in mind, users
     can consider the arrangement of excerpted passages as a guide to further study of <name
      type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name>’s reflections on ancient Greek
     democracy.</p>
    <p>In the environment provided by electronic publication, all readers can immediately confront
     our implied interpretation with the underlying evidence and offer suggestions for improvement
     by electronic response to the <ref target="mailto:tmartin@holycross.edu">author</ref> and <ref
      target="mailto:cwb@stoa.org">contributors</ref>. In this way the collaborative work that
     produced this article can continue as a scholarly conversation on a wide scale.</p>

    <p>Every attempt has been made to be consistent in the translation of crucial Greek terms, such
     as <foreign xml:lang="xgrc">polis</foreign>, but the flexibility of meaning of some of them makes
     absolute consistency impossible. The following translations are used as consistently as
     possible:</p>

     sense to indicate rule by the many in what he defines as the <foreign xml:lang="xgrc"
      >straight</foreign> or correct system of government of this type. (By contrast, he refers to
     rule by the many in a diverging and thus <soCalled>erroneous</soCalled> system as

     divisions as represented in your Web browser may not correspond exactly to this numeration. </p>
    <p>Since, for technical reasons, the links must go to the first line of a section and therefore
     usually not to the first line of the cited reference itself, the particular lines referred to
     may appear rather far down from the beginning of the section. In some cases, the particular
     lines may be far enough from the beginning of the section that they will not be on the screen
     when the section is first displayed, and it will then be necessary to scroll until they appear.
     Please be sure to note the precise line number within the section to which you are linking
     before following that link so that you can locate that line by scrolling. </p>

     <emph>Introduction to the groups of excerpted passages</emph>
    </p>
    <p>The first three groups of excerpted passages provide context for the remaining groups. The
     first of the three concerns elements of the definition of the ancient Greek city-state
      (<foreign xml:lang="xgrc">
      <w xml:lang="xgrc" n="po/lis">polis</w>
     </foreign>) in the <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl> because <name type="ancientAuthor">Aristotle</name>’s discussion of
     democracy pertains to this type of political state. The next group concerns the definition of
     the citizen because it took citizens to constitute a system of government in the city-state, of
     which democracy was one. The third concerns the definition of different systems of government
     in the city-state, especially the notion that democracy is, in <name type="ancientAuthor"
      >Aristotle</name>’s view, a <soCalled>diverging</soCalled> system of
     government. The remaining groups of passages concern democracy itself. In the paraphrases of
     the passages, square brackets [ ] indicate editorial additions to the ancient text. </p>
    <p>The text of the <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1252a" type="cts-urn">
      <title>Politics</title>
     </bibl> is conventionally divided into eight <soCalled>Books,</soCalled> whose proper order is
     disputed. These book divisions do not appear in the continuous text to which the passages are
     linked. For those who wish to correlate the passages cited below to the book in which they
     appear, the following list indicates the division of sections in the books as traditionally
     numbered. Since the links go to the beginnings of sections, they will not go to the part of the
     section at which a particular book begins. For example, Book 4 begins at <bibl
      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1288b10" type="cts-urn">1288b10</bibl>, but the link goes
     to the beginning of <bibl n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1288b" type="cts-urn"
     >1288b</bibl>, from which point it is necessary to scroll forward to reach line 10. </p>

     appears to list five types of democracy, but the next two passages list only four.]</p>
    <list>
     <item>The first type of democracy is particularly based on equality, where neither the rich nor
      the poor has pre-eminent authority, but both are similar [in their authority]. Still, since
      the majority rules and the <soCalled>people</soCalled> will be in the majority, this is a
      democracy.</item>
     <item>Another type is when <term sortKey="citizens">citizens</term> have to meet a financial
      assessment to qualify for service in public offices, but the amount is low and any citizen
      possessing the required amount can have a share.</item>
     <item>Another type is when anyone whose <term sortKey="citizenship">citizenship</term> is not
      open to dispute [because they are descended from a family of <term sortKey="citizens"
       >citizens</term> whose <term sortKey="citizenship">citizenship</term> has never been
      questioned?] can have a share, and the law rules.</item>
     <item>Another type is when absolutely everyone, so long as they are <term sortKey="citizens"
       >citizens</term> [and even if they became citizens in a special way, such as being made <term
       sortKey="citizens">citizens</term> in political revolution, and did not inherit their <term
       sortKey="citizenship">citizenship</term>], can have a share in public offices, and law
      rules.</item>
     <item>Another type is the same in the other ways [as in type no. 4?] but the multitude rules,
      not law. This happens when decrees [passed by the multitude] have authority rather than the
      law having authority. Here demagogues arise, and the multitude becomes a monarch.</item>

      n="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg035:1293a12" type="cts-urn">1293a12</bibl>: [There are only
     four types of democracy listed in this passage.]</p>
    <list>
     <item>One type of democracy is when farmers and those possessing a moderate amount of property
      have authority. They govern themselves in accordance with law because their work leaves them
      little leisure time. They therefore meet in the <term sortKey="assembly">assembly</term> only
      as absolutely necessary [to make decisions on matters not covered by the code of law]. A share
      [in the system of government] is open to anyone as soon as they meet the financial assessment
      set by law. They cannot be at leisure [for public service in governing] unless there is public
      revenue [to subsidize their participation].</item>
     <item>A second type is when anyone whose <term sortKey="citizenship">citizenship</term> is
      beyond question by his descent is entitled to have a share but only those with leisure [for
      public service in governing] actually have a share. The laws rule because there is no public
      revenue.</item>
     <item>A third type is when all who are free are entitled to a share in the system of
      government, but they do not in fact take part for the reason previously stated. Therefore, law
      necessarily rules.</item>
     <item>A fourth type is the last type to arise in cities. Since cities have become far larger
      than before and have public revenue from which to pay subsidies for public service, everyone
      is now able to participate. Even the poor have the leisure for public service thanks to the
      payments. Their private business and affairs are not an impediment for their public service,
      but such things are an impediment for the rich, who therefore frequently avoid service in the
       <term sortKey="assembly">assembly</term> or the <term sortKey="courts">courts</term>. In this
      way the multitude of the poor wins authority over the system of government, not the
      laws.</item>

     quantity of the multitude of the poor is so large as to overbalance the quality of the rich,
     according to the formula just explained [in the text preceding this passage], there democracy
     springs up naturally. What type of democracy it is will depend on what type of population is
     preeminent. For example, if it is a multitude of farmers, then it will be the first type of
     democracy it is the first kind. If it is a multitude of craftsmen and wage-earners, then it
     will be the final type, and so on with the types in between. </p>

      >1293a12</bibl>, as listed above]. This type of democracy has a multitude that is mostly
     farmers or herders, whose work keeps them too busy to meet frequently in the assembly. They do
     not wish to serve in offices, where there is no great profit in it. Everyone will elect <term
      sortKey="archons">magistrates</term> and conduct audits of them and serve in the <term

     </foreign>, one should look to the law of the <placeName key="Aphytis">Aphyteans</placeName>,

     to having a multitude consisting of farmers is to have a herding people. The herding class have
     strong bodies and dispositions fit for military service. The other sorts of multitudes from
     which democracies are constituted are far worse. For craftsmen, merchants, and laborers lead
     lives devoid of excellence, and they are always in the marketplace and in the city and thus
     able to attend <term sortKey="assembly">assemblies</term>. It is easier to create a good
     democracy in a place where the fields of the city-state are located at some distance from the
     city and the multitude must dwell out in the country [to work in the fields and are thus not
     easily able to come to the urban center to attend meetings]. Even where there is a crowd of
     merchants, <term sortKey="assembly">assemblies</term> should not be held without the multitude

     type of democracy, in which everyone is in the partnership, is not easy for every city to
     maintain, nor is it easy for this type to endure because its laws and its habits are not well
     composed. Demagogues expand its citizen body by allowing in those of illegitimate birth or born
     to only one citizen parent. If the rabble grow too numerous, they create disorder and can
     provoke the notable members of the population to resistance against the democracy. This type of
     democracy is made stronger by introducing institutions to mix everyone up together, as <name
      type="person">Cleisthenes</name> did at <placeName key="Athens">Athens</placeName>. This type
     of democracy promotes disorderly living, with a lack of control over women, children, and
     slaves, and a toleration for everyone living as he pleases, for the many prefer living like
     this to living with prudence and moderation. </p>

     become property of the gods, not of the public, to prevent corrupt court judgments meant to
     secure a distribution to the population from the confiscated property; large penalties should
     be imposed for frivolous prosecutions to prevent harassment of the rich; if there are no
     [additional] sources of public revenues besides taxes [on individuals], confiscations, and
     corrupt court judgments to pay subsidies to the multitude for attending the <term

     practice stimulates more demand for this sort of distribution; at the same time, the multitude
     should be kept from becoming overly poor, since this development creates wretched [and thus
     excess] democracy; money should be provided from public revenues to the poor so that they can
     acquire land for farming or learn a craft and become better off over time; the rich should be
     taxed to provide pay [to ordinary <term sortKey="citizens">citizens</term> to enable them to
     attend] necessary meetings, but the rich should be released from unnecessary public service;
     the rich should divide the poor <term sortKey="citizens">citizens</term> among themselves and

     rather by what makes it possible to run a system of government democratically. In the
     democracies that seem to be the most democratic, they do what is not advantageous because they
     define freedom badly. For democracy is thought to be defined by two things: by the majority
     having authority and by freedom. Justice is then thought of as equality, and equality as that
     whatever the multitude decides is what is authoritative. Freedom and equality are doing
     whatever one wishes. So in this sort of democracy everybody lives as he wants and for whatever
     goal he craves. This is a contemptible thing. Living according to one’s
