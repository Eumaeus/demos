 <head >Summary</head>
 <p >This article argues that poetry—the Homeric epics and the works of the
 tragedians—enjoyed an importance to the democratic government of
 Athens equal to that of the city’s laws. Like laws, poetry was
 powerful. Like the law, too, poetry was regulated and, at times, manipulated
 according to the political needs of the city and its rulers.</p>

 <head >Poetry in the Courtroom</head>
 <p > The pervasive civic importance of poetry in Athenian democracy during the
 <date  from='-0499' to='-0300'>fifth and fourth centuries BCE</date>
 has been obvious since ancient times. The figure <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demades</name> in <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plutarch</name> calls the
 <term  sortKey='theoric_fund'>
 <soCalled >theoric fund</soCalled>

 citizens, the <quote >glue of the democracy</quote> (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>ὡς

 Timarchus</title>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> asks his jury
 to apply wisdom from the poetry of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Euripides</name>
 in their judgment of the case before them: </p>
 <quote  rend='block'>

 <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>Σκέψασθε δέ, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, τὰς γνῶμας ἃς
 ἀποφαίνεται ὁ ποιητής. Ἤδη δὲ πολλῶν πραγμάτων φησὶ

 </p>
 <p >Consider, O Athenians, the sentiments that the poet expresses. He says that
 in the past he has been the arbiter of many disputes, just as you jurors are
 now, and he says that he makes his decisions not based on the testimony of
 witnesses, but on the habits and company of the defendant… he did
 not shrink from claiming that a man’s character is none other than
 that of those with whom he likes to associate. Therefore it is right for you
 also to use the same logic as <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Euripides</name> in
 the case of <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name>. (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:153' type='cts-urn'>Aeschines, <title >Against

 </quote>
 <p > In fact throughout his prosecution <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>
 provides carefully selected citations of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Homer</name>
 and the tragedians to support his claim that <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name> has led the kind of life which, according to Athenian law,
 precludes him from speaking in the democratic <term  sortKey='assembly'>assembly</term>. Moreover, whenever <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> cites poetry, he uses the same wording as when he cites a law
 or an affidavit: he calls on the <term >grammateus</term> to read out specific
 passages, and then he comments upon them. Compare the following two passages: </p>

 receives a depraved beginning to its education straightaway from childhood,
 he believed that the citizens that resulted from such badly brought up

 <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>’ use of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Homer</name> and <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Euripides</name> as evidence in a court case shows the student of the Athenian
 <term >dēmos</term> a great deal about the important role that
 poetry played in the democracy. Like written laws that guaranteed constitutional
 rights for all citizens, the poetry of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Homer</name>
 and <name  type='ancientGenre'>tragedy</name> was the common intellectual and
 moral property of the <term >dēmos</term>, and a standard by which
 behavior could be assessed. The <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>law court</term>
 with its jury of citizens was a place in which the behavior of individuals was
 constantly being evaluated in relation to the values of the <term >polis</term>
 as a whole.</p>
 <p > It is essential for any student of the Athenian <term >dēmos</term> to
 understand the authority of poetry in the civic discourse of <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>. The authority of poetry, moreover, is not
 restricted to <name  type='ancientGenre'>tragedy</name> (as we have seen) nor to
 disputes in the courts. Carolyn Higbie has shown the way in which <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Homer</name> and the Iliadic <soCalled >past</soCalled>
 could be cited as authoritative evidence in all sorts of disputes, including
 Athenian claims to the island of <placeName  key='Salamis'>Salamis</placeName>
 and an incident that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Herodotus</name> relates in
 which the Athenians and Spartans make their claims to command of the Greek navy
 and army against the Persians before <name  type='person'>Gelon</name> of
 <placeName  key='Syracuse'>Syracuse</placeName>.<note  place='footnote'>

 </note> Higbie points out that in <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aristotle</name>’s <title >Rhetoric</title> the philosopher cites
 poets from the past as one of two types of witnesses, the ancient and the recent
 (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>οἱ μὲν παλαιοὶ οἱ δὲ πρόσφατοι</foreign>), and he
 notes the ancient as the more secure. He does this within in a passage in which
 he himself cites <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Sophocles</name>’

 <head >Guarding Poetic Texts</head>
 <p > But the formula by which <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> calls upon
 the <term >grammateus</term> to read aloud a segment of poetry raises for me many
 questions. What text does the <term >grammateus</term> read when he is called
 upon to do so? Is it one provided by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>? What kind of state texts, if any, existed for <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Homer</name> and the tragedians? I would like to
 explore the question of state regulation of dramatic texts in the context of the
 definition of poetry that I have given above—that is the common
 intellectual and moral property of the <term >dēmos</term>. To what
 extent, and more importantly, why did the Athenian democracy regulate that
 possession? <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plutarch</name>’s <title >Lives

 <p >[Next he proposed] that bronze statues of the poets <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschylus</name>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Sophocles</name>, and <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Euripides</name> be

 </quote>
 <p > It is generally believed that this was done to protect the texts from
 actors’ or other kinds of interpolation which was corrupting the
 textual tradition of the plays and likewise their subsequent performance, and
 the verb <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>παραναγινώσκειν</foreign> has another meaning that
 may be relevant here, which is <soCalled >to collate</soCalled> or <soCalled >to
 compare</soCalled>. That the texts would need to be protected from
 insertions is an interesting one to which I will return. </p>
 <p > For the moment I am interested in the word <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>φυλάττειν</foreign> (<soCalled >to guard</soCalled> or <soCalled >to
 protect</soCalled>) which <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plutarch</name> tells us
 was the purpose of the law. This word has a military connotation which is
 intriguing, but it also turns the tragedies of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschylus</name>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Sophocles</name>, and <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Euripides</name> into a <term >ktēma</term> (a
 <soCalled >possession</soCalled>) of the sort <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Thucydides</name> hoped his history would be (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0003.tlg001:1.22' type='cts-urn'>Thuc. 1.22</bibl>). This is a possession that
 the Athenian <term >dēmos</term> wants to keep and store away in the
 <name  n='Metroon, Athens' type='site'>Metroon</name> in its function as a
 treasury, in order to regulate and control how that possession is used. The
 <name  n='Metroon, Athens' type='site'>Metroon</name> is also of course the
 Athenian archive, a place where laws are kept. The <term >grammateus</term> in
 fact, that same figure who as we have seen reads out the laws and affidavits and
 citations of poetry to the jury, according to the law of <name  type='person'>Lycurgus</name> will read out the plays to the actors so that they can
 learn their parts. It is not clear whether the actors were even allowed to make
 copies for themselves (and again the meaning of the verb <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>παραναγινώσκειν</foreign> comes in to play here). </p>

 <div  n='Tyrants' type='Section' xml:id='Tyrants'>
 <head >Poetry and the Tyrants</head>
 <p > I would like to suggest that this kind of regulation of poetry by the Athenian
 democracy is reminiscent of the control over poetry once asserted by the
 Peisistratid tyranny. Gregory Nagy, in his 1990 book <title >
 <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Pindar</name>’s <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Homer</name>
 </title>, has shown how the possession of poetry was a primary sign of the
 tyrant’s wealth, power, and prestige.<note  place='footnote'>

 </note> But as Nagy writes on this passage: <quote >as long as private interests
 control the public medium, there is the ever-present danger of a
 premeditated selective control over the content of poetry, leading to
 stealthy distortions or perversions of the poetic truth.</quote>
 </p>
 <p > It is interesting that the control of poetry by tyrants threatens a perversion
 of truth, while regulation of dramatic texts by the <term >dēmos</term>
 serves to protect the texts from insertions or alterations and even performance
 by others. There is no guarantee of course that the Athenian state copies of
 these texts were not already quite corrupted. We know very little about the
 publication and circulation of books within the lifetime and in the century
 after the deaths of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschylus</name>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Sophocles</name>, and <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Euripides</name>, but it must have been sporadic and completely
 unregulated. We have no idea on what exemplar the Athenian state texts were to
 be based in the Lycurgan law. I think we can see that the
 <term >dēmos</term> in its attempt to protect the texts assumes the role
 that the tyrant once played in its selective control of poetry.</p>

 </note> At this critical time (that is <date  when='-0500'>ca 500 BC</date>)
 comes the first stone <name  n='Theater of Dionysus, Athens' type='site'>theater</name> of <name  type='god'>Dionysus</name> at the foot of the <name  n='Acropolis, Athens' type='site'>Acropolis</name>. The organization of the
 great Athenian dramatic festival at the birth of the democracy is an assertion
 of power by way of the control of poetry, not unlike the reorganization of the
 Panathenaia by the Peisistratids. </p>
 <p >
 <date  when='-0337'>More than a century and a half later</date> after the battle
 of <placeName  key='Chaeronea'>Chaeronea</placeName>
 <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> was once again in a position in which
 it needed to assert control. <name  type='person'>Lycurgus</name>, a prominent
 statesman with either enormous personal influence or else acting in some
 official capacity undertook at this time a building program. Among other
 projects the docks and harbors and various things in connection with the navy
 were increased and improved, and the <name  n='Theater of Dionysus,  Athens' type='site'>theater</name> of <name  type='god'>Dionysus</name> was rebuilt.
 <name  type='person'>Lycurgus</name> was also at this time in charge of
 festivals and processions, and in this context presumably he proposed the law
 concerning the dramatists. I stress the navy and the theater in conjunction as
 the means by which <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>, under the
 direction of <name  type='person'>Lycurgus</name>, attempted to rebuild and
 reassert the authority of the <term >polis</term> after <placeName  key='Chaeronea'>Chaeronea</placeName>. Just as for the tyrants of archaic
 Greece, the possession and control of poetry and its performance was a crucial
 (though ultimately unsuccessful) demonstration of wealth, power, and prestige
 for the Athenian <term >dēmos</term> in the years following <date  when='-0338'>338</date>. </p>
 <p > To conclude I would like to return to the parallels I raised in the beginning
 between citations of laws and poetry by orators as evidence in the <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>law courts</term>. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> and other proponents of democracy name written laws to
 which all citizens are bound, that is <term >isonomia</term>, as the cornerstone
 of any democratic government. The Persian <name  type='person'>Otanes</name>
 points out in <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001:3.82' type='cts-urn'>Herodotus
 3.82</bibl> that tyranny and oligarchy have the power to cast aside law,
 disregard it or distort it (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τῇ ἔξεστι ἀνευθύνῳ
 ποιέειν τὰ βούλεται</foreign>… <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>νόμαιά τε
 κινέει πάτρια</foreign>). In a democracy, laws are the common property of
 all citizens: </p>
 <quote  rend='block'>
 <p >
 <foreign  xml:lang='grc'>διοικοῦνται δ᾽ αἱ μὲν τυραννίδες καὶ ὀλιγαρχίαι

 <p >Autocracies and oligarchies are administered according to the tempers of
 their lords, but democratic states according to established laws. And be
 assured, fellow citizens, that in a democracy it is the laws that guard the

 who have a government based upon equality and law, must guard against those
 whose words violate the laws or whose lives have defied them; for then only
 will you be strong, when you cherish the laws (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>εὐνομῆσθε</foreign>)… (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001:4' type='cts-urn'>Aeschines <title >Against

 </quote>
 <p > I would point out to the student of the Athenian democracy that poetry, like the
 laws, had power, and for that reason it had to be regulated—that is
 protected and guarded against those who would violate it. </p>
 <p > But I also think that if we focus too closely on the importance of the state
 copies for the establishment of the text we are missing the point somewhat. The
 law (in the only source in which we have it) does not specify from what exemplar
 the state copies are to be made. We will probably never know if the law did in
 fact specify such a thing. What we do know of the law is that the texts were to
 be placed in the <name  n='Metroon, Athens' type='site'>Metroon</name>, and
 statues of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschylus</name>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Sophocles</name> and <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Euripides</name> were to be placed in the <name  n='Theater of  Dionysus, Athens' type='site'>theater</name>. This suggests two things: 1) that the law
 had an honorific purpose, and not necessarily textual one. And 2) that the
 poetry of these three great tragedians was being symbolically elevated to the
 status of law in the civic discourse, as we so often find in the law courts and
 public speeches in the <date  from='-0399' to='-0300'>fourth
 century</date>.</p>

 <note  place='inline' rend='bracket' resp='CD'>For another study of the use of
 Homeric and other poetry in the Athenian public arena, see also <bibl  type='secondary'>Andrew Ford, “Reading Homer from the Rostrum:
 Poems and Laws in Aeschines” <title >Against
 Timarchus</title>’ (in <title >Performance Culture and Athenian
 Democracy</title>, ed. Simon Goldhill and Robin Osborne,

 from Poetry in Attic Orators of the Fourth Century BCE”
 [<title >American Journal of Philology</title> 85 (1964):
 155-172]</bibl>). Ford adduces many of the same key passages that I have
 examined here, but his argument differs from mine. Whereas Ford stresses the
 individual motives of public speakers in seeking to display their education
 and sophistication in their citations of Homeric and other poetry for their
 ad hoc legal or political argumentation, I argue for the inherent
 traditional authority of such poetic traditions, from the archaic period
 onward, in civic discourse.</note>
