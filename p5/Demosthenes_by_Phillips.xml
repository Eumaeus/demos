 </ref><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> son of <name  type='person'>Demosthenes</name> of the deme <name  type='deme'>Paeania</name> (<date  from='-0384' to='-0322'>384-322</date>) is generally regarded as the greatest of the Attic orators.
 At the age of seven he lost his father and was entrusted, along with his inheritance, to
 guardians. When he turned eighteen, however, he discovered that most of the money was
 gone; and so, after studying under <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Isaeus</name>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> took his guardians to court in <date  when='-0364'>364</date>. He delivered his first speeches (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg027' type='cts-urn'>27</bibl>-<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg031' type='cts-urn'>31</bibl>) in these cases, and their success launched his career as a speechwriter.</p>
 <p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’ long and illustrious political
 career began in <date  when='-0355'>355</date>, when he composed speeches for the trials of
 <name  type='person'>Androtion</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg022' type='cts-urn'>22</bibl>) and <name  type='person'>Leptines</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg020' type='cts-urn'>20</bibl>). In the latter half of the <date  from='-0355' to='-0350'>350s</date> he continued to write forensic speeches for
 high-profile cases (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg024' type='cts-urn'>24 <soCalled >Against
 Timocrates</soCalled></bibl>, <date  when='-0353'>353</date>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg023' type='cts-urn'>23 <soCalled >Against Aristocrates</soCalled></bibl>,
 <date  when='-0352'>352</date>), and also delivered his first speeches before the
 Athenian <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term>, including <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg014' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >On the Symmories</soCalled> (14)</bibl> in
 <date  when='-0354'>354</date>, <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg013' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >For
 the Megalopolitans</soCalled> (13)</bibl> in <date  when='-0353'>353</date>, and <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg015' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >On the Liberty of the Rhodians</soCalled>
 (15)</bibl> in <date  when='-0351'>351</date>.</p>
 <p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> rose to prominence as the foremost Athenian
 opponent of <name  type='person'>Philip II</name>. In <date  when='-0351'>351</date> he
 delivered his <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg004' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >First
 Philippic</soCalled> (4)</bibl>, in which he called for a more aggressive stance
 toward the rising threat of <placeName  key='Macedon'>Macedon</placeName>. In the three
 <soCalled >Olynthiacs</soCalled> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg001' type='cts-urn'>1</bibl>-<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg003' type='cts-urn'>3</bibl>) of <date  when='-0348'>348</date> he urged his countrymen to send aid to <placeName  key='Olynthus'>Olynthus</placeName>, which was under Macedonian attack; but the auxiliary expeditions
 sent by <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> could not prevent <name  type='person'>Philip</name>’s capture of the city. In <date  when='-0346'>346</date>
 <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> took part in the embassies to <name  type='person'>Philip</name> regarding the <soCalled >Peace of <name  type='person'>Philocrates</name>;</soCalled> on his return from the second embassy he accused
 several fellow ambassadors, including <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>, of
 taking bribes from <name  type='person'>Philip</name>, and he attacked <name  type='person'>Philip</name> for negotiating in bad faith. Despite his dissatisfaction, later in the
 year he delivered the speech <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg005' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >On the
 Peace</soCalled> (5)</bibl>, counseling the Athenians to abide by its terms.</p>
 <p >For the remainder of the decade <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> continued
 to agitate against <name  type='person'>Philip</name> at home and abroad, delivering the
 <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg006' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >Second Philippic</soCalled>
 (6)</bibl> in <date  when='-0344'>344</date> and <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg008' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >On the Chersonese</soCalled> (8)</bibl>
 and the <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg009' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >Third Philippic</soCalled>
 (9)</bibl> in <date  when='-0341'>341</date>. In <date  when='-0343'>343</date>
 <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> brought <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> to trial and gave the oration <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg019' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >On the False Embassy</soCalled>
 (19)</bibl>; <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> escaped a death sentence by a
 mere thirty votes. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’ policy of
 resistance to <name  type='person'>Philip</name> triumphed, but the resistance itself
 failed at the battle of <placeName  key='Chaeroneia'>Chaeroneia</placeName> in <date  when='-0338'>338</date>. Nonetheless, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>
 remained influential at <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>. In <date  when='-0336'>336</date>
 <name  type='person'>Ctesiphon</name> proposed that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> be awarded a gold crown for his public services; <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> brought an indictment against <name  type='person'>Ctesiphon</name> for making an <term  sortKey='law_glossary@paranomon'>illegal
 proposal</term>, but the case did not go to trial until <date  when='-0330'>330</date>.
 At <name  type='person'>Ctesiphon</name>’s trial <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> delivered his most famous oration, <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg018' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >On the Crown</soCalled> (18)</bibl>, and
 <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> was soundly defeated.</p>
 <p ><name  type='person'>Philip</name>’s assassination in <date  when='-0336'>336</date> led to an abortive attempt at revolt in which <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> played a prominent role. For a while afterwards the Athenians
 acclimated themselves to Macedonian hegemony. In <date  from='-0343' to='-0343'>324-323</date>, however, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> was implicated
 in a scandal involving <name  type='person'>Harpalus</name>, the fugitive treasurer of
 <name  type='person'>Alexander the Great</name>. Accused of appropriating twenty talents
 of the funds <name  type='person'>Harpalus</name> had brought to <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> was convicted, fined,
 and imprisoned for failure to pay, but escaped and went into exile. Upon <name  type='person'>Alexander</name>’s death in <date  when='-0323'>323</date> he
 returned to <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> and again advised resistance to
 <placeName  key='Macedon'>Macedon</placeName>. After <name  type='person'>Antipater</name>’s defeat of the Greek rebels in the <soCalled ><placeName  key='Lamia'>Lamian</placeName> War,</soCalled>
 <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, facing a death sentence, committed suicide
 by poison. (See also <name  type='ancientGenre'>Oratory</name>.)</p>
