 </ref><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> son of <name  type='person'>Atrometus</name> of the deme <name  type='deme'>Cothocidae</name> (<date  from='-0390' to='-0322'>390-ca. 322</date>) was an actor before becoming a politician, for which he
 is repeatedly lampooned by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>. He served on the
 Athenian embassies to <name  type='person'>Philip</name> regarding the <soCalled >Peace of
 <name  type='person'>Philocrates</name>;</soCalled> in the period which followed his
 support for the peace brought him into constant conflict with <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>. Upon his return from the second embassy in <date  when='-0346'>346</date> he was accused of taking Macedonian bribes by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> and his associate <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name>. He
 counterattacked by prosecuting <name  type='person'>Timarchus</name> for speaking in the
 <term  sortKey='Assembly'>Assembly</term> after having prostituted himself, and won his
 case with the oration <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg001' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >Against
 Timarchus</soCalled> (1)</bibl>. When <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>
 revived the allegations of bribery in <date  when='-0343'>343</date>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> defended himself with the speech <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >On the False Embassy</soCalled>
 (2)</bibl>. He barely escaped conviction, and his influence was clearly on the wane.</p>
 <p >In spring <date  when='-0339'>339</date>, as an Athenian representative at the meeting of
 the <term  sortKey='Amphictyonic_League'>Amphictyonic League</term>, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> successfully deflected the wrath of the League
 from <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> onto <placeName  key='Amphissa'>Amphissa</placeName>. However, the Fourth Sacred War against <placeName  key='Amphissa'>Amphissa</placeName> bore bitter fruit for the Athenians as well, as it brought <name  type='person'>Philip</name> into central Greece and eventually led to the battle of
 <placeName  key='Chaeroneia'>Chaeroneia</placeName>. In <date  when='-0336'>336</date>
 <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> indicted <name  type='person'>Ctesiphon</name>
 for proposing the grant of a gold crown to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>.
 When the case came to trial six years later, <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>
 delivered his oration <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003' type='cts-urn'><soCalled >Against
 Ctesiphon</soCalled> (3)</bibl>. Despite the legal merits of his case, he received
 less than twenty percent of the jury’s votes, and he left <placeName  key='Athens'>Athens</placeName> to teach <name  type='ancientGenre'>rhetoric</name> on
 <placeName  key='Rhodes'>Rhodes</placeName>. (See also <name  type='ancientGenre'>Oratory</name>.)</p>
