 <p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, <title >Against <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name> (I)</title>, see also <name  n='oratory' type='ancientGenre'>Oratory</name>. This is a speech on behalf of <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> in
 a perjury suit that he has brought against <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name>. It is the
 first of two speeches delivered during this same trial (see also <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg046' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 46</bibl>). <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name> was a friend of <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> (the same <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> of <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36</bibl>) who testified on <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>’s behalf
 in the special plea (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>παραγραφή</foreign>) at the centre of that
 trial. The speeches <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36</bibl>,
 <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45</bibl> (this speech), and
 <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg046' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 46</bibl> all concern the
 estate of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>, an Athenian banker. According to <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s will, <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>, a
 former slave of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>, was given <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s widow in marriage as well as control over <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s business affairs until <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s younger son, <name  type='person'>Pasicles</name>, came of age.
 This arrangement did not work because <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’
 (the older son of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>) was constantly spending money from
 the common family fund. To correct this problem, and to ensure that young <name  type='person'>Pasicles</name> would be left with an inheritance when he came of age,
 <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> elected to distribute all of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s property equally between the two sons. This did not satisfy
 <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>, who then sued <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>
 for 3000 drachmas (see also <term  sortKey='Money'>Money</term>). He claimed that <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> had withheld that sum of money when the property was
 distributed; the matter was submitted to arbitration and was it was decided that <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> did indeed owe the money, which he then paid (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:3' type='cts-urn'>Dem.
 36.3</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:14' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.14-15</bibl>). Twenty years passed, and
 <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> decided that <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>
 had defrauded him of 20 talents in bank-stock. <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>, on the
 other hand, asserted that this was preposterous and filed a special plea to have this new
 suit dismissed, which is the direct concern of <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36</bibl>. In that speech, <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> asserts
 that, since twenty years have passed, the statue of limitations (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὸν τῆς προθεσμίας νόμον</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:26' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.26</bibl>) had expired and that <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> had released him from any further financial obligations
 after he paid the 3000 drachmas. We learn in the present speech (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:1' type='cts-urn'>Dem.
 45.1</bibl>) that <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> suffered an embarrassing defeat
 in the previous case because, he claims, he has been <cit >
 <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:1' type='cts-urn'/>
 <quote >overwhelmed by false testimony</quote>
 </cit> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:1' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.1</bibl>; see also <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:6' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.6</bibl>). <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> now claims that the testimony of <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>’s witnesses (specifically <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name>)
 was false and that several of the documents produced by <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>
 (the will of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>, <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>’s lease of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s
 property, and <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ statement releasing <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> of further financial responsibility) were forged and should
 not be credited as evidence. <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> further states that
 <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name> has merely sided with <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> because of possible monetary gain and that he has ignored a distant
 family tie to <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:53-54' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.53-54</bibl>) which,
 according to <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ notions of proper social
 practice (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:65' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.65</bibl>), would require that he support <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>. Finally, he closes his speech with an attack on the character of
 <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>, ridiculing his barbarian background and accusing him
 of carrying on an adulterous relationship with <name  type='person'>Archippe</name>, <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ mother, which resulted in the birth of <name  type='person'>Pasicles</name>, <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ younger
 brother (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:72-74' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.72-74</bibl>; also <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:83-84' type='cts-urn'>Dem.
 45.83-84</bibl>). The speech closely resembles genuine works of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> stylistically. However, its authorship is
 disputed on the grounds that it would be strange (and perhaps unethical) for <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> to write a speech in defence of <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036' type='cts-urn'>Dem.
 36</bibl>) and then turn to write a speech (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45</bibl>) attacking <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> in the harshest
 terms. <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Plutarch</name> expressly states that Demosthenes did
 write the speech (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0007.tlg054:15' type='cts-urn'>Plut. Dem. 15</bibl>) . <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name>, a bitter political rival of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, does accuse him of accepting money from <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> to write a speech and then revealing its contents to <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg002:165' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 2.165</bibl>; <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0026.tlg003:173' type='cts-urn'>Aeschin. 3.173</bibl>).
 However, were it known that <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> had indeed
 written a speech for <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>, we would expect <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Aeschines</name> to mention it. We know that <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s death is placed at <date  when='-0370'>370 BCE</date> (source
 for date: <bibl  n='OCD3'>
 <title >OCD</title>
 <edition >3</edition>
 </bibl>) and that the lawsuit that <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36</bibl> is concerned with takes place about 20 years later, around <date  when='-0350'>350 BCE</date>. The present speech can be said to have taken place sometime
 after that.</p>
