<p >(<name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, <title >Against <name  type='person'>Boeotus</name> II</title>; see also <name  n='oratory' type='ancientGenre'>Oratory</name>). This is a speech attributed to <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>’s authorship, written for a man named <name  type='person'>Mantitheus</name>, who was suing his half-brother <name  type='person'>Boeotus</name>. This is the second time <name  type='person'>Mantitheus</name> sued <name  type='person'>Boeotus</name> (see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg039' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 39</bibl>). The plaintiff was the legitimate son of <name  type='person'>Mantias</name>, who had two other, illegitimate sons, the older one of whom was <name  type='person'>Boeotus</name>, the defendant. After <name  type='person'>Mantias</name> died, all three sons agreed to divide their father’s property three ways. But a dispute arose regarding their mothers' money: the defendant claimed that his mother had brought one talent (see <term  sortKey='Money'>Money</term>) into the marriage, which he did not want to share with his half-brothers. The half-brothers claimed that their mother had given <name  type='person'>Mantias</name> (the father) 100 minae (see <term  sortKey='Money'>Money</term>), which they did not want to share with <name  type='person'>Mantitheus</name>. In the speech, <name  type='person'>Mantitheus</name> says that the case had been in arbitration for eleven years before coming to trial, and he further claims that the half-brothers might try to poison him. Based on the style of this speech, it is generally thought that this speech is not actually by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name> (source: <bibl >A.T. Murray, <title >Demosthenes IV</title> [Cambridge, Loeb: 1936] 481</bibl>). The speech was written sometime after <date  when='-0348'>348 BCE</date>, which is the date for the first suit between this plaintiff and defendant (see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg039' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 39</bibl>) (Source for date: <bibl >R. Sealey, <title >Demosthenes and his Time: a study in defeat</title> [Oxford, 1993] 144</bibl>) </p>
