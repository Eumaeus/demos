 <p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, <title >Against <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name> (II)</title>, see also <name  n='oratory' type='ancientGenre'>Oratory</name>. This is a speech by <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> delivered
 during the same trial for which <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45</bibl>
 was given. <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>, who is the plaintiff in the suit,
 delivered the first speech (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45</bibl>), to
 which <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name> gave a reply. This present speech is <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ reply to <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name>’ reply. <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name> was a friend of
 <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> (the same <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> of <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36</bibl>) who testified on <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>’s behalf in the special plea (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>παραγραφή</foreign>) at the centre of that trial. The origin of this feud dates to the
 death of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>, an Athenian banker. According to <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s will, <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>, a
 former slave of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>, was given <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s widow in marriage as well as control over <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s business affairs until <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s younger son, <name  type='person'>Pasicles</name>, came of age.
 This arrangement did not work because of <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’
 (the older son of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>) greed in constantly taking from the
 common family fund. To correct this problem, and to ensure that young <name  type='person'>Pasicles</name> was left with an inheritance when he came of age, <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> elected to distribute all of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s property equally between the brothers. This did not satisfy
 <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>, who then sued <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>
 for 3000 drachmas (see also <term  sortKey='Money'>Money</term>). He claimed that <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> had withheld that sum of money when the property was
 distributed; the matter was submitted to arbitration and was it was decided that <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> did owe the money, which he then paid (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:3' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.3</bibl>; also <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:14' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.14-15</bibl>). Twenty years passed and
 <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> decided that <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>
 had defrauded him of 20 talents in bank-stock. <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>, on the
 other hand, knew that this was preposterous and filed a special plea in bar of action (in
 other words, a plea to have the case dismissed) which is the direct concern of <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36</bibl>. In that speech, <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> asserted that, since twenty years have passed, the statue of limitations
 (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὸν τῆς προθεσμίας νόμον</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:26' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.26</bibl>) had expired and that <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> had released him from any further financial obligations
 after he paid the 3000 drachmas. We learn in <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ first address (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:1' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.1</bibl>) that <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> suffered an embarrassing
 defeat in the previous case because, he claimed, he had been <cit >
 <quote >overwhelmed by false testimony</quote>
 <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:1' type='cts-urn'/>
 </cit> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:1' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.1</bibl>; see also <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:6' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.6</bibl>). <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> now claimed that the testimony of <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>’s witnesses (specifically <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name>)
 was false and that several of the documents produced by <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>
 (the will of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>, <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>’s lease of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s
 property, and <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ statement releasing <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> of further financial responsibility) were forged and should
 not be credited as evidence. <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> further stated that
 <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name> has merely sided with <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> because of possible monetary gain and that he ignored a distant family
 tie to <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:53-54' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.53-54</bibl>) which, according to
 <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ notions of proper social practice
 (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:65' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.65</bibl>), would require that he
 support <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>. Finally, he closed that speech with an
 attack on the character of <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>, ridiculing his barbarian
 (that is, non-Greek) background and accusing him of carrying on an adulterous relationship
 with <name  type='person'>Archippe</name>, <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ mother, which resulted in the birth of <name  type='person'>Pasicles</name>, <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ younger brother
 (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:72-74' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.72-74</bibl>; also <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:83-84' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.83-84</bibl>). So, we now arrive at
 <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ second speech in answer to a long
 defence made by <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg046:2' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 46.2</bibl>). He begins this speech in the
 same way that he closed the previous one: with an attack upon the character of his
 opponent. He also continues to accuse <name  type='person'>Stephanus</name> of false
 testimony. The body of the speech, however, contains <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ attempt to prove that his father (<name  type='person'>Pasion</name>) never made a will at all (see, for example, at <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg046:15' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 46.15</bibl>). This, however, raises an
 important question: Why did <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> wait so long to
 challenge his father’s alleged will (or, for that matter, to claim the
 bank-stock at issue in <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36</bibl>)? We read
 that, when <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> did sue <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> for 20 talents in bank-stock (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36</bibl>), he stated that he had done so <cit >
 <quote >at the earliest opportunity</quote>
 <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:5' type='cts-urn'/>
 </cit> (i.e. some twenty years later) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:5' type='cts-urn'>Dem.
 45.5</bibl>). <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> leaves us with no answers to this
 question. Due to the poor quality of argumentation and a lack of organisation, this speech
 is not accepted to be the work of <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>. Occurring
 during the same trial, this speech can be dated simultaneously with <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45</bibl>, sometime after <date  when='-0350'>350 BCE</date>. (See also <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36</bibl>,
 <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45</bibl>).</p>
