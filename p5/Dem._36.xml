 <p ><name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>, <title >For <name  type='person'>Phormio</name></title>, see also <name  n='oratory' type='ancientGenre'>Oratory</name>. This speech was written by <name  type='ancientAuthor'>Demosthenes</name>
 on behalf of <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>, a former slave, who is being sued by his
 adopted son, <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>. The occasion of the speech is <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>’s special plea in bar of action (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>παραγραφή</foreign>), in other words, a plea that the case not be tried
 before a jury (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:2' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.2</bibl>, also, <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:5' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.5</bibl>; for pleas barring
 action, see <term  sortKey='lawcourt'>People’s Court</term>). This was in
 response to <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>’ attempt to bring <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> to trial to extract 20 talents (see also <term  sortKey='Money'>Money</term>) that he claims that <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> has
 fraudulently withheld from him. The history of the case can be traced back almost 20 years
 prior to this trial, from the death of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>, the former owner
 of <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>. <name  type='person'>Pasion</name> had placed great
 trust in <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>, placing him in charge of his banking
 operations and his shield factory. <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s will
 provided for <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> to marry <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s widow, to assume guardianship of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s ten-year-old son, <name  type='person'>Pasicles</name>, and to
 retain control of the shield factory and bank until <name  type='person'>Pasicles</name>
 came of age. But the interests of the young son were threatened by the actions of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s elder son, <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>, who continually dipped into the common funds that <name  type='person'>Pasion</name> had left his family (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:8' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.8</bibl>). Because the
 inheritance of the younger son was endangered, <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> elected
 to distribute all of the property evenly. When <name  type='person'>Pasicles</name> came of
 age, the bank was given over to <name  type='person'>Pasicles</name> and the shield factory
 to <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>, thus releasing <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> of any further obligation. This, however, did not satisfy <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name>, who later took an opportunity to sue <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> for three thousand drachmas which he claimed that <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> had withheld out of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>’s property. This matter was referred to arbitration and the sum
 was paid by <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> who was granted a new release from all
 obligations relating to the estate of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name> (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:14' type='cts-urn'>Dem.
 36.14-15</bibl>). Now, twenty years later, <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> is
 demanding more money from <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>, in the sum of twenty talents
 worth of banking stock which he claims that <name  type='person'>Phormio</name>
 fraudulently withheld (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:4' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.4-7</bibl> and <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:11' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.11-13</bibl>). <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> entered a special plea in bar of action which is the
 subject of this particular case. His speech gives three reasons for doing so. First, <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> is inordinately greedy and an uncontrolled spendthrift
 (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:41' type='cts-urn'>Dem.
 36.41</bibl>). Second, <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> appeals to the fact that <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> had released him from all obligations. And, third,
 since twenty years had passed, the statute of limitations had expired (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὸν τῆς προθεσμίας νόμον</foreign>) (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:26' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.26</bibl>). We learn from
 <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:6' type='cts-urn'>Dem.
 45.6</bibl> that <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> won this special plea
 overwhelmingly, with <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> not even receiving one-fifth
 of the votes of the jury, and thus having to pay a fine for bringing a frivolous suit
 (<foreign  xml:lang='grc'>τὴν ἐπωβελίαν</foreign>; see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045:6' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45.6</bibl>). <name  type='person'>Pasion</name> died in <date  when='-0370'>370 BCE</date> (source for date:
 <bibl  n='OCD3'>
 <title >OCD</title>
 <edition >3</edition>
 </bibl>) and references in this speech (<bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:19' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.19</bibl>, <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:26' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 36.26</bibl>, and <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg036:38' type='cts-urn'>Dem.
 36.38</bibl>) allow it to be dated to about twenty years after the death of <name  type='person'>Pasion</name>, to about <date  when='-0350'>350 BCE</date> (source for
 date: <bibl >A.T. Murray, <title >Demosthenes IV</title> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical
 Library; 1946] 321</bibl>). The feud between <name  type='person'>Phormio</name> and
 <name  type='person'>Apollodorus</name> was carried on in another lawsuit; see <bibl  n='urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0014.tlg045' type='cts-urn'>Dem. 45</bibl>.</p>
